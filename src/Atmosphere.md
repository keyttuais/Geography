# Atmosphere
These are the atmospheric components of different planets in our solar system. 

## Composition of Earth's Atmosphere
- Gasses
  - Below is the composition of gasses in the Earth's atmosphere.

  - Few important gases
    - Oxygen --> For life
    - Nitrogen --> To soil for plants
    - CO2 --> As a greenhouse gas
    - Dust particles also play an role in absorhing the heat (greenhouse gasses)
    - Dust particles also play a role in cloud formation, precipitation and also in scattering the sunlight.

> The amount of sun light we receive, not just depends on the tilt and revolution of the earth but indirectly it is also related to the dust particles in the atmosphere that blocks the sunshine from reaching the ground.
  
- Water vapour
  - Water vapor is H2O is gaseous form at room temperature (not boiling temperature like steam). The water vapor in the atmosphere is added by evaporation, transpiration. It is removed when it turns into clouds and precipitation such as rain. Water vapor in the atmosphere absorbs heat such as terrestrial radiation and hence helps in keeping the earth warm. Normally water vapor in the atmosphere decreases with height also decreases as we move from equator towards poles.
- Dust particles
  - Dust particles are small solid particles suspended in the air and hence keep floating in the air.
  - The source of dust particles in the air include sea salt suspended when ocean water droplets risen by waves evapourate in air leaving the salt suspended in the air. In the case of land, the solid particles soot (unburnt particles from flame), ash (burnt particles), polins released by plants and meteor dust (objects falling from space burning in the air)

The total height of the atmosphere is 3500 km but out of this nearly 99% of all the gas is in the lower 32 kms. Which is nearly 1% of the atmosphere. Almost all the water vapor in the atmosphere is also found in the bottom 8 to 18 kms only. Very minute amount is found up to 90 kms (very less - trace). Almost all the dust particles are in the bottom 8 to 18 kms. Even in this bottom 18 kms most of the dust particles are in the lowest layer close to the earth surface and this amount decreases as we go higher up to 18 kms.
  
## Vertical Structure of Atmosphere
- The vertical structure of atmosphere extends from the surface of the ocean to a height of 3500 kms. The *troposphere* is the region where most of the gasses, water vapor & dust particles exist mainly due to earth's gravity. This is the region where these mix and circulate within the region that's why the name Troposphere (tropo which is a Greek word meaning Mixing). The mixing takes place when due to the surface of the earth being *hotter* near equator, the air in contact with the earth's surface gets heated and rises creating convection. This rise, at maximum is observed up to 18 kms after which the gasses turn pole wards. At the same time the polar surface being colder, the sinking part of the air convection is found there from a height of up to 8 kms. This sinking part of convection then moves equator wards. This is how mixing in the troposphere takes place.
> Tropopause is the End of Troposphere and the height depends on multiple factors like seasons, latitude etc.
- As the air rises above the equator it expands and tends to cool. Also because we go higher the atmospheric pressure also decreases, hence expansion and cooling of the air. Therefore in the troposphere temperature decreases as we go higher at the rate of 1 degree celsius for every 165 meters. Hence this is nearly equal to 6.5 degrees every 1km.
- This is why the temperature at tropopause above the equator is nearly -80 degree celsius whereas above pole the temperature decreases as we go higher. The height of the tropopause also varies. For hotter regions or hotter seasons it is higher and colder regions or colder seasons, it is lower.
> Around the mid latitude tropopause is higher in summer (up to 15 kms) and in this region only during winters the tropopause lowers up to 12.5 kms.
