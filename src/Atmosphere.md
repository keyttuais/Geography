# Atmosphere
These are the atmospheric components of different planets in our solar system. 

## Composition of Earth's Atmosphere
- Gasses
  - Below is the composition of gasses in the Earth's atmosphere.

- Water vapour
  - Water vapor is H2O is gaseous form at room temperature (not boiling temperature like steam). The water vapor in the atmosphere is added by evaporation, transpiration. It is removed when it turns into clouds and precipitation such as rain. Water vapor in the atmosphere absorbs heat such as terrestrial radiation and hence helps in keeping the earth warm. Normally water vapor in the atmosphere decreases with height also decreases as we move from equator towards poles.
- Dust particles
  - Dust particles are small solid particles suspended in the air and hence keep floating in the air.
  - The source of dust particles in the air include sea salt suspended when ocean water droplets risen by waves evapourate in air leaving the salt suspended in the air. In the case of land, the solid particles soot (unburnt particles from flame), ash (burnt particles), polins released by plants and meteor dust (objects falling from space burning in the air)
