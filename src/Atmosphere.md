# Atmosphere
These are the atmospheric components of different planets in our solar system. 

## Composition of Earth's Atmosphere
- Gasses
  - Below is the composition of gasses in the Earth's atmosphere.

  - Few important gases
    - Oxygen --> For life
    - Nitrogen --> To soil for plants
    - CO2 --> As a greenhouse gas
    - Dust particles also play an role in absorhing the heat (greenhouse gasses)
    - Dust particles also play a role in cloud formation, precipitation and also in scattering the sunlight.

> The amount of sun light we receive, not just depends on the tilt and revolution of the earth but indirectly it is also related to the dust particles in the atmosphere that blocks the sunshine from reaching the ground.
  
- Water vapour
  - Water vapor is H2O is gaseous form at room temperature (not boiling temperature like steam). The water vapor in the atmosphere is added by evaporation, transpiration. It is removed when it turns into clouds and precipitation such as rain. Water vapor in the atmosphere absorbs heat such as terrestrial radiation and hence helps in keeping the earth warm. Normally water vapor in the atmosphere decreases with height also decreases as we move from equator towards poles.
- Dust particles
  - Dust particles are small solid particles suspended in the air and hence keep floating in the air.
  - The source of dust particles in the air include sea salt suspended when ocean water droplets risen by waves evapourate in air leaving the salt suspended in the air. In the case of land, the solid particles soot (unburnt particles from flame), ash (burnt particles), polins released by plants and meteor dust (objects falling from space burning in the air)

The total height of the atmosphere is 3500 km but out of this nearly 99% of all the gas is in the lower 32 kms. Which is nearly 1% of the atmosphere. Almost all the water vapor in the atmosphere is also found in the bottom 8 to 18 kms only. Very minute amount is found up to 90 kms (very less - trace). Almost all the dust particles are in the bottom 8 to 18 kms. Even in this bottom 18 kms most of the dust particles are in the lowest layer close to the earth surface and this amount decreases as we go higher up to 18 kms.
  
## Vertical Structure of Atmosphere based on Temperature
- The vertical structure of atmosphere extends from the surface of the ocean to a height of 3500 kms. The *troposphere* is the region where most of the gasses, water vapor & dust particles exist mainly due to earth's gravity. This is the region where these mix and circulate within the region that's why the name Troposphere (tropo which is a Greek word meaning Mixing). The mixing takes place when due to the surface of the earth being *hotter* near equator, the air in contact with the earth's surface gets heated and rises creating convection. This rise, at maximum is observed up to 18 kms after which the gasses turn pole wards. At the same time the polar surface being colder, the sinking part of the air convection is found there from a height of up to 8 kms. This sinking part of convection then moves equator wards. This is how mixing in the troposphere takes place.
> Tropopause is the End of Troposphere and the height depends on multiple factors like seasons, latitude etc.
- As the air rises above the equator it expands and tends to cool. Also because we go higher the atmospheric pressure also decreases, hence expansion and cooling of the air. Therefore in the troposphere temperature decreases as we go higher at the rate of 1 degree celsius for every 165 meters. Hence this is nearly equal to 6.5 degrees every 1km.
- This is why the temperature at tropopause above the equator is nearly -80 degree celsius whereas above pole the temperature decreases as we go higher. The height of the tropopause also varies. For hotter regions or hotter seasons it is higher and colder regions or colder seasons, it is lower.
> Around the mid latitude tropopause is higher in summer (up to 15 kms) and in this region only during winters the tropopause lowers up to 12.5 kms.
- Above the troposhere we come to the next region which is the *stratosphere*. The stratosphere has almost a constant height from the earth surface. It is around 50 kms and the ending point of the stratosphere is stratopause. The stratosphere is known for the presence of Ozone gasses in this region which starts from a height of 10 km above pole and gradually its lower height increases towards equator where at the equator it is found at a height of 20 km only.
- Hence Ozone is found completely above the tropopause. It is found up to around stratopause but maximum density is found only up to 35 kms. Hence most of the Ozone in the atmosphere is found in stratosphere. This Ozone absorbs the sun's UV radiations such as complete absorption of UV_c radiation, part absorption of UV_b radiation and no absorption of UV_a. These UV rays absorbed by the ozone are harmful for life and detremental for non-living surfaces or objects.
- Hence harmful UV radiations are absorbed by ozone in the stratosphere and therefore stratosphere ozone is known as Good Ozone. A very small amount of ozone is also found in the troposphere which is harmful for life to inhale. Hence any ozone in the troposphere is called Bad Ozone.
- The UV radiation absorbed by the Ozone in the atmosphere comes from the sunlight, hence most of this UV radiation is abosrbed by the upper part of the ozone in the stratosphere and converted to heat energy which heats up the stratosphere. Because most of this heat is in the upper part of the stratosphere hence as we go higher in the stratosphere from tropopuase to the stratopause the temperature gradually keeps increasing. The temperature at the stratopause is -15 celsius.
- Above the stratopause, we have mesosphere (meso means middle) and it will end at mesopause. In the mesosphere there is no Ozone, no heat absorption and hence no heating of the atmosphere by the sun's heat directly. Hence as we go higher the temperature decreases in the mesosphere. The temperature at mesopause is -100 degrees celsius. This is the coldest region in the earth's atmosphere.
- Above the mesosphere, we have the thermosphere which is from 80km to 400km. In the thermosphere region, the atmospheric gasses become very sparse or rare and because very few gas particles are present in the atmosphere, hence even by absorbing less heat they become very hot, also the high energy sun radiation such as some X rays and gamma rays are also absorbed here extremely heating of the thermosphere and hence known as thermosphere. The temperature at the thermopause might reach up to as high as 1500 degree celsius. Because of this the gasses in the thermosphere get ionized and hence this region of the thermosphere is also called Ionosphere, because the gasses get ionized. This ionosphere is useful for reflecting back radio wave signals to the earth useful in long range radio services.
- When the ionosphere interacts with solar charged particles, mainly solar winds in the magnetic field gaps of the earth near the polar circles, the interaction of these solar particles and the ionosphere creates a polar sky light phenomenon known as *Aurora*. (Northern lights or polar lights). In the northern hemisphere this aurora is visible from *Boreal forest* and hence known as Aurora Borealis forest and in the southern hemisphere it is visible from some parts of Australia and hence known as Aurora australis.
- When we go above 400 kms up to a height of 3500 kms we call that region the Exosphere. Beyond that we have space which is seperated by Exopause. The temperature in the exosphere will keep on increasing and temperature at exopause is 5000 degree celsius.
### Vertical Structure of Atmosphere based on Chemical Composition
- As per this classification, there are just two divisions of the earth's atmosphere vertically.
  - Lower region of the atmosphere up to a height of 88 kms from the surface of the earth known as *Homosphere* due to the homogeneous composition of gasses.
  - Upper region of the atmosphere from a height of 88 kms from the surface of the earth till 3500 kms is known as *Heterosphere*. This is known as the heterosphere because the gaseous composition in this region of the atmosphere is heterogeneous or non-uniform. Because heavier gasses are more in the lower part like N2, O2 and lighter gasses are more in the upper part like helium and hydrogen.

Around the earth, there is another layer of charged particles found known as the *Van Allen Belt*. This belt is magnetically trapped around the earth and divided into two parts known as the inner val allen belt found between 10000 to 12000 kms from the earth's surface and the second one as the outer van allen belt found at 13000 to 60000 kms around the earth. The Van Allen belt is generally harmful for any space mission travelling in this region as it gets burnt / harmed by the Van Allen belt. Hence space missions generally have a van allen protection shield built on them to protect them from this belt.
