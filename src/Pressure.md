# Pressure
- Pressure is force experienced over an area. Atmospheric pressure is defined as the weight of the overlying column of air at any place. Normally atmospheric pressure is measured and talked about at mean sea level which we call as normal atmospheric pressure which is the weight of air column over the 1 unit area of ocean surface. Atmospheric pressure acts in all directions at a given place just like the pressure inside the balloon filled with air acts in all directions from inside on the balloon surface and not only downwards towards the ground.

### Measure of atmospheric pressure
- We use the device known as the Barometer and the normal atmospheric pressure is around 1013.2 millibars (where millibars is the unit of atmospheric pressure). This is what we call as Normal atmospheric pressure at mean sea level.
- High and low pressure conditions
  - Generally high pressure and low pressures are not measured against a standard or average value. They are indeed compared against each other and derive the high / low pressure.
### How high and low pressure conditions are created.
- In the atmosphere any phenomena where heating or cooling is involved we call it Thermal phenomena. If only movement is involved without heating or cooling we call it a Mechanical phenomena.

| **Pressure System** | **Vertical Air Movement** | **Horizontal Air Movement**    | **Associated Temperature** |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Low Pressure        | Rising (Outward aloft)    | Converging (Inward at surface) | Hot / Warm                 |
| High Pressure       | Sinking (Inward aloft)    | Diverging (Outward at surface) | Cool / Cold                |
- As the atmospheric pressure at the sea level is 1013.2 millibars due to the air column. As we go higher the air column reduces and the atmospheric pressure goes on decreasing in absolute terms at the rate of nearly 3.5 millibars for every 30 meters.
- Hence when we reach near the tropopause the pressure will never be same or similar to the earth surface pressure and would always be low. Hence when we say high or low pressure near tropopause this is due to comparing the two pressures near tropopause. (region 2 and region 4 being compared). and this high and low pressure in the upper atmosphere is not with respect to or compared to the surface pressure conditions. Because surface pressure conditions will always be higher than the upper atmospheric pressure conditions. Pressure is always compared at the same horizontal level and not compared vertically.
> We should not compare the pressure between tropopause and the surface of the earth to understand which is low pressure.
- Horizontally seen air is moving from High pressure to Low pressure. The movement of air from high pressure to low pressure is known as Wind. Simply said, wind always moves from high pressure to low pressure. The difference between the pressure between two regions is called Pressure difference where pressure difference (PD) is equal to high pressure - low pressure. The pressure difference is the direction of high pressure to low pressure.
- In these two cases as we see the pressure difference between AC and AB is the same but the rate of change of pressure between AB is slower than the rate of change of pressure between AC. Because the wind is moving because of change in pressure, hence wherever the pressure will change faster there the wind will also move faster. Hence in this case the speed of wind AB is slower than the speed of wind AC.
- The rate of change of pressure discussed above is known as Pressure gradient which is defined as pressure difference per unit distance.
- Hence if we calculate the pressure gradient AB -> PG (AB) = 20 / 500 kms = 0.04 mb/kms and PG (AC) = 20 / 100 kms = 0.2 mb/kms. Since the pressure gradient between AC is higher, hence wind speed between AC will also be higher.
> Pressure difference tells us about the direction of wind from higher pressure to lower pressure. Pressure gradient, which is the rate of change of pressure difference, rather tells us about the speed and the strength of the winds. If the pressure gradient is higher the wind will be faster and stronger.
