# Pressure
-Pressure is force experienced over an area. Atmospheric pressure is defined as the weight of the overlying column of air at any place. Normally atmospheric pressure is measured and talked about at mean sea level which we call as normal atmospheric pressure which is the weight of air column over the 1 unit area of ocean surface. Atmospheric pressure acts in all directions at a given place just like the pressure inside the balloon filled with air acts in all directions from inside on the balloon surface and not only downwards towards the ground.

### Measure of atmospheric pressure
-We use the device known as the Barometer and the normal atmospheric pressure is around 1013.2 millibars (where millibars is the unit of atmospheric pressure). This is what we call as Normal atmospheric pressure at mean sea level.
