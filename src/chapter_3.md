# Climate & Atmosphere

## Atmosphere

These are the atmospheric components of different planets in our solar system. FIGURE  
Composition of the earth’s atmosphere:

### Composition of Earth atmosphere

1. Gasses  
   1. FIGURE  
2. Water vapor : Water vapor is H2O in gaseous form at room temperature (not boiling temperature like steam). The water vapor in the atmosphere is added by evaporation, transpiration. It is removed when it turns into clouds and precipitation such as rain. Water vapor in the atmosphere absorbs heat such as terrestrial radiation and hence helps in keeping the earth warm. Normally water vapor in the atmosphere decreases with height and also decreases as we move from equator towards the poles.  
3. Dust particles : Dust particles are small solid particles suspended in the air and hence keep floating in the air. The source of dust particles in the air include sea salt suspended when ocean water droplets risen by waves evaporate in air leaving the salt suspended in air. In the case of land, the solid particles soot (unburnt particles from flame), ash (burnt particles), polins released by plants and meteor dust (objects falling from space burning in the air).

The total height of the atmosphere is 3500 km but out of this nearly 99% of all the gas is in the lower 32 kms. Which is nearly 1% of the atmosphere. Almost all the water vapor in the atmosphere is also found in the bottom 8 to 18 kms only. Very minute amount is found up to 90 kms (very less \- trace). Almost all the dust particles are in the bottom 8 to 18 kms. Even in this bottom 18 kms most of the dust particles are in the lowest layer close to the earth surface and a very decreasing amount as we go higher up to 18 kms.  
Few important gasses

1. Oxygen \- For life  
2. Nitrogen \- To soil for plants  
3. CO2 \- As a greenhouse gas  
4. Dust particles also play a role in absorbing the heat (greenhouse gasses)  
5. Dust particles also play a role in cloud formation, precipitation and also in scattering the sunlight.

### Vertical Structure of atmosphere

The Vertical atmosphere extends from the surface of the ocean to a height of 3500 kms. The tropopause is the region where most of the gasses, water vapor & dust particles exist mainly due to earth’s gravity. This is the region where these three mix and circulate within the region that’s why the name Troposphere (tropo which is a Greek word meaning Mixing). So the troposphere is the region of mixing of gasses, water vapor and dust particles. This mixing takes place when due to the surface of the earth being hotter near the equator, the air in contact with the earth surface gets heated and rises creating convection. This rise maximum observed is up to 18 kms after which the gasses turn pole wards. At the same time the polar surface being colder, the sinking part of the air convection is found there from a height of up to 8 kms. This sinking part of convection then moves equator wards. This is how mixing in the troposphere takes place. As the air rises above the equator it expands and tends to cool. Also because as we go higher the atmospheric pressure also decreases, hence expansion and cooling of the air. Therefore in the troposphere temperature decreases as we go higher at the rate of 1 degree celsius for every 165 meters. Hence this is nearly equal to 6.5 degrees every 1 km. This is why the temperature at tropopause above the equator is nearly \-80 degree celsius whereas above pole the temperature near tropopause is \-45 degree celsius. Hence throughout the troposphere the temperature decreases as we go higher. The height of the tropopause also varies. For hotter regions or hotter seasons it is higher and colder regions or colder seasons are lower. Hence around the mid latitude tropopause is higher in summer (up to 15 kms) and in this region only during winters the tropopause lowers up to 12.5 kms.  
Above the troposphere we come to the next region which is the stratosphere. The stratosphere has almost a constant height from the earth surface. It is around 50 kms and the ending point of the stratosphere is stratopause. The stratosphere is known for the presence of Ozone gasses in this region which starts from a height of 10 km above pole and gradually its lower height increases towards equator where at equator it is found at a height of 20 km only. Hence Ozone is found completely above the tropopause. It is found up to around stratopause but maximum density is found only up to 35 kms. Hence most of the ozone in the atmosphere is found in the stratosphere. This ozone absorbs the sun’s UV radiations such as complete absorption of UV\_c radiation, part absorption of UV\_b radiation and no absorption of UV\_a. These UV rays absorbed by the ozone are harmful for life and decremental for non living surfaces or objects. Hence harmful UV radiations are absorbed by ozone in the stratosphere and therefore stratosphere ozone is known as Good Ozone. A very small amount of ozone is also found in the troposphere which is harmful for life to inhale. Hence any ozone in the troposphere is called Bad Ozone. The UV radiation absorbed by Ozone in the atmosphere comes from the sunlight, hence most of this UV radiation is absorbed by the upper part of the ozone in the stratosphere and converted into heat energy which heats up the stratosphere. Because most of this heat is in the upper part of the stratosphere hence as we go higher in the stratosphere from tropopause to stratopause the temperature gradually keeps increasing. The temperature at the stratosphere is \-15 degree celsius.   
Abovethe stratopause, we have a mesosphere (meso means middle) and it will end at mesopause. In the mesosphere there is no Ozone, no heat absorption and hence no heating of the atmosphere by the sun's heat directly. Hence as we go higher the temperature decreases in the mesosphere. The temperature at mesopause is \-100 degrees celsius. This is the coldest region in the earth’s atmosphere.   
Above the mesosphere we have the thermosphere which is from 80 km to 400 km. In the thermosphere region, the atmospheric gasses become very sparse or rare and because very few gas particles are present in the atmosphere, hence even by absorbing less heat they become very hot also the high energy sun radiation such as some X rays and gamma rays are also absorbed here extremely heating of the thermosphere and hence known as thermosphere. The temperature at the thermopause might reach up to as high as 1500 degree celsius. Because of this the gasses in the thermosphere get ionized and hence this region of the thermosphere is also called Ionosphere, because the gasses get ionized. This ionosphere is useful for reflecting back radio wave signals to the earth useful in long range radio services. 

When the ionosphere interacts with the solar charged particles, mainly solar winds in the magnetic field gaps of the earth near the polar circle, the interaction of these solar particles and the ionosphere creates a polar sky light phenomenon known as Aurora. (northern lights or polar lights). In the northern hemisphere this aurora is visible from Boreal forest and hence known as Aurora Borealis forest and in the southern hemisphere it is visible from some parts of Australia and hence known as Aurora australis. This is created when solar charged particles interact with the ionosphere.

When we go above 400 kms up to a height of 3500 kms we call that region the Exosphere. Beyond that we have space which is separated by Exopause. The temperature in the exosphere will keep on increasing and temperature at exopause is 5000 degree celsius.  
The above discussed structure of the atmosphere from troposphere to exosphere is on the basis of temperature change characteristics. 

Another vertical classification of the atmosphere is done on the basis of chemical composition of the atmosphere. As per this classification, there are just two divisions of the earth’s atmosphere vertically

1. Lower region of the atmosphere up to a height of 88 kms from the surface of the earth known as Homosphere due to the homogenous composition of gasses.  
2. Upper region of the atmosphere from a height of 88 kms from the surface of the earth till 3500 kms is known as the Heterosphere. This is known as the heterosphere because the gaseous composition in this region of the atmosphere is heterogeneous or non-uniform. Because heavier gasses are more in the lower part like N2, O2 and lighter gasses are more like helium and hydrogen in the upper part.

Around the earth there is another layer of charged particles found known as the Van Allen Belt. This belt is magnetically trapped around the earth and divided into two parts known as the inner van allen belt found between 1000 to 12000 kms from the earth surface and the second one as the outer van allen belt found at 13000 to 60000 kms around the earth. The Van Allen belt is generally harmful for any space mission traveling in this region as it gets burnt / harmed by the Van Allen belt. Hence space missions generally have a van Allen protection shield built on them to protect them from this belt.

### Heat Budget

##### Heating and cooling of Atmosphere : 

###### *The source of heat* 

1. Almost all heat that the earth has comes from the sun.  
2. Very small amount comes from volcanic eruptions (Negligible)  
3. Earth’s internal heat radiated (Negligible)

###### *Insolation*

The sun’s heat comes to the earth in the form of Infrared radiations. (Visible light, UV radiations). Earth’s surface receives only IR, Visible light and some UV radiations. All the radiation coming from the sun to the earth is known as Insolation. The full form of insolation is incoming, solar, radiation. Of the total radiation released by the sun, we get 2 parts out of a billion parts, we call it the 2 billionth part of total radiation released by the sun reaches the upper layers of the atmosphere. This is also known as 2 langlays of radiation. It is 1.94 Cal / Cm2 / Min at the top of the atmosphere. This is not on the earth's surface.

The insolation received on the earth’s surface (oceans and continents) at different places and latitudes is not the same, as different locations receive different amounts of insolation as discussed below.

###### *Factors affecting the insolation on the earth*

These are the factors 

1. Rotation Effect  
   1. Day side receives the sunlight and the night side does not receive the sunlight.  
   2. On a tilted axis, different duration of day and night.  
      1. Different duration of sunlight  
      2. Different angle of sunlight at different places (latitudes)  
2. Revolution Effect  
   1. This revolution changes the tilt with respect to the sun during different months. June northern hemisphere tilted towards the sun, December southern hemisphere tilted towards sun. Hence different Insolation therefore different seasons.  
3. Angle of inclination  
   1. At lower latitudes insolation has to travel a lesser distance in the atmosphere whereas at higher latitudes insolation has to travel more distance in the atmosphere.  
   2. Traveling in the atmosphere affects the insolation by absorbing, scattering and diffusing the sunlight due to gasses, water vapor and dust particles. Hence more sunlight reaches the earth surface at lower latitudes and less sunlight reaches the earth surface at higher latitudes.  
4. Slope & aspect   
   1. On flat plain surfaces the sunlight might fall perpendicular and hence more intense, but on mountainous surfaces because of slope of the mountain, the sunlight might fall inclined and hence less intense.   
   2. Similarly, aspect means the mountain side facing the sun will receive more sunlight whereas the mountain side not toward the sun will receive less or no sunlight and hence insolation might vary on the same mountain on two sides.  
5. Transparency of atmosphere  
   1. In the region which is cloudy or foggy or misty or more humid, less insolation will reach the surface of the earth whereas in clear sky regions (sunny regions) more sunlight will be there. Similarly in deserts or dry plain regions if it is too dusty then less sunlight will reach the surface of the earth.

Hence because of these factors, insolation on the earth surface varies from place to place and time to time during the day or during seasons. 

###### *Average insolation received* 

The maximum received is at tropic which is 320 Watts / M2 and at poles 70 Watts / M2 and near the equator it is less than 320 Watts / m2 (because equator is generally cloudy whereas tropic is generally clear sky and pole is high slope due to high latitude).  
At the same latitude continents receive more sunlight than the oceans because oceans are relatively more cloudy than the continents. The maximum insolation is received in tropical desert regions.

###### *Heating of Atmosphere*

How different parts of the atmosphere are heated is discussed below. Now we are mostly talking of the troposphere. The earth’s atmosphere gets less heated directly by insolation as greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere are not capable of absorbing the insolation directly. Hence the insolation directly reaches the earth's surface mostly rather heats up the earth’s surface. When the earth’s surface get heated it also releases back heat radiation but this heat radiation of the earth is not so high energy radiation, therefore the greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere are capable of absorbing this radiation of the earth known as Terrestrial radiation. The greenhouse gasses by absorbing this heat, heats up the atmosphere. Hence practically seen the atmosphere get’s most of it’s heat directly from the earth in the form of terrestrial radiation (low energy radiation) and not in the form of insolation. This is another reason why the lower part of the troposphere is hotter than the upper part of the troposphere as the lower part is closer to the earth’s surface.  
The other ways in which the earth’s atmosphere gets heated is conduction, convection, advection and condensation as shown below.

In the hotter regions the lower part of the air is directly in contact with the hotter surface and hence is heated by the Conduction. This heated air might rise and heat up the upper air by Convection. The heated air might move towards the nearby cooler region and heat up the lower air there, this is known as Advection. Terrestrial radiation might heat up the whole of the atmosphere more in lower parts and less in upper parts.

Here we will understand how much insolation we receive and what happens to that insolation ultimately. We know over the billions of years of earth’s formation the earth has not been storing the sun’s insolation in any substantial way forever. It does store the insolation for some time and releases it back fully. This is why the total heating of the earth does not increase continuously. Hence simply said the net long term insolation or heat stored by the earth is zero. Simultaneously for the billions of years of earth’s formation, the earth has not even been consistently releasing its own heat substantially. Otherwise the earth would have become extremely cold over the billions of years since its formation. Hence simply said the net long term heat released is also zero. (this heat is earth’s residual heat).

###### *Vertical Heat Received*

Hence it can be concluded that earth’s net vertical heat budget is a balanced budget. Simply said if the earth received 100 units or 100% of the insolation, then the whole 100 units or 100% released is also released back over the long term. The insolation received and the heat released by the earth are shown in the two diagrams below.

Scattered means send here and there. 23 units out of 100 are scattered by the atmosphere (dust and water vapor). Out of these scattered 23 units, 6 units returned back to space directly. The remaining 17 units are absorbed by the earth surface. Another 36 units reach the earth’s surface and out of these 2 units are reflected back to space. So 34 units are absorbed by the surface of the earth. Around 27 units are reflected back by the clouds in the atmosphere. The remaining 14 units are absorbed directly by the atmosphere (from exosphere, thermosphere, some in mesosphere, mostly in stratosphere).  
Hence simply said we can conclude that of the total insolation received (100 units) in the beginning itself the earth returns back 35 units of the received insolation. It stores or keeps or absorbs only 65 units of the heat. (14 in the atmosphere and 51 on the surface of the earth).

###### *Vertical Heat released*

51 units were with the earth surface and 14 units were with the atmosphere. Total 65 units are remaining. Out of these 51 on the earth’s surface, 23 units are released as radiation and of these, 6 get absorbed by the atmosphere. Therefore 17 goes to space directly. Of the 51 units of heat in the earth’s surface, 23 are radiated by the earth out of which 6 get absorbed by the atmosphere and the remaining 17 are released to space. Out of these 51 another 9 units are released by Convection to the atmosphere from earth’s surface. Now the left over 19 units are involved in Evaporation and Condensation. So these 19 units are added to the atmosphere by the process of Condensation. The remaining 19 units of the heat in the earth’s surface is released by evaporation and absorbed in the atmosphere after condensation.

Hence as we see out of 51 units with the earth’s surface 34 units is absorbed by the atmosphere heating mainly the lower atmosphere (troposphere) because the heat is released from below. Hence it is said that the heat from the earth’s surface is the main cause for heating the atmosphere, mainly the lower atmosphere where life exists. The atmosphere also already had 14 units earlier hence simply said the atmosphere heats up with a total of 14 \+ 34 which is 48 units of heat, which the atmosphere holds for Some time to warm itself (atmosphere). But as we know no heat is stored for a long time, hence even these 48 units stored for some time are released back to space. The total units released to the space is 65 which means the net absorbed is the same as net released. Hence as we see in the second diagram that finally 65 units of heat is fully released back to space. Hence vertical heat budget is completed.

In this process we find that though the atmosphere is not storing any heat permanently but it does store around 48 units of heat for some time out of every 100 units of heat received. Hence when it receives new 100 units of heat, it releases the previous 48 units of heat back to space which was heating up the atmosphere earlier and stored another 48 units from the newly received hundred units to keep the atmosphere warm. This is a continuous process and hence the atmosphere remains warm continuously. In the atmosphere the heat is stored by the Greenhouse gasses and agents such as water vapor, dust particles etc. Hence if there are more greenhouse gasses and agents in the atmosphere (added naturally or by human beings) the atmosphere will get warmer known as Global warming which we are presently experiencing because of increased greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere by human activities.

###### *Horizontal Heat distribution on the earth*

How much of the heat received / distributed in which region of the earth is the horizontal heat distribution of the earth. 0 to 45 deg is warmer and 45 to 90 is colder. In the warmer region 0 to 40-45 degrees heat received is more than the heat released. Hence there is a heat surplus in this region keeping the region warmer. By the same logic in the colder region heat received will be less than heat released and hence a net heat deficit in the colder region as shown because of which the colder region remains colder. But over the long period we find that neither the warmer region keeps getting warmer with more heat surplus nor the colder region keeps getting cooler by more and more heat deficit. This implies that there is a continuous heat transfer from the heat surplus region to the heat deficit region on the earth ensuring that the warm region does not get much warmer and colder region does not get much colder. Hence the horizontal heat transfer on the earth balances the net heat on the earth ensuring that horizontal heat budget is also a balanced budget.

###### *How does Horizontal heat transfer taking place*

This heat transfer takes place in the Air, (atmosphere), Water (oceans mainly). These are the major things moving on the earth from polar to tropic and tropic to polar. The major horizontal heat transfer on the earth takes place through the air or through the ocean waters.   
We will focus right now on the horizontal heat transfer in the atmosphere. These are the different ways heat transfer happen in atmosphere

1. Wind  
   1. Jet streams  
   2. Cyclones  
   3. Tornadoes  
   4. Monsoon  
2. Moisture or Humidity  
   1. In the form of clouds (condensation)  
   2. Rains  
   3. Fog  
3. Pressure conditions

All of these things together we can call them Weather and Climate. Heat transfer happens due to all above factors and leads to weather and climate. The ultimate cause of weather and climate is Heat transfer in the atmosphere. Heat transfer in the atmosphere takes place through different mechanisms such as different types of winds, clouds, rains, etc finally lead to what we call as weather and climate. Simply said, all the weather and climate phenomena in the atmosphere are ultimately means of heat transfer in the atmosphere. When the water vapor turns into water from gas to liquid form it releases heat to the atmosphere by condensation.  Hence the atmosphere will get warmer. Similarly when water turns into Ice on the land or on the ocean surface it again releases heat to the atmosphere.

###### *Difference between weather and climate*

1. Measure : Both weather and climate are measured using  
   1. Temperature  
   2. Pressure  
   3. Winds  
   4. Humidity  
   5. Clouds  
   6. Precipitation  
   7. Visibility  
   8. Sunshine  
      These above are called the building blocks or elements of weather and climate  
2. Period :   
   1. Weather is short period (minutes to up to 1 to 2 years)  
   2. Climate is a long period (at least 30 to 50 years average)  
3. Effect :   
   1. Weather affects day to day lifestyle.  
   2. Climate affects lifestyle.  
4. Economic activities  
   1. Cropping pattern will be affected by climate  
   2. Crop health or crop status is affected by weather

Now we will take up all the 8 elements of weather and climate to understand them in detail

###### *Factors of Weather and Climate*

Temperature : it is the measure of measurable heat in the object. Cold is not opposite of heat, it is the absence of heat. Darkness is the absence of light. There are two types of heat energy. One changes temperature, we call it Specific heat whereas the energy which changes state (solid \<-\> liquid \<-\> gas), this energy does not change temperature, it is called Latent heat. The temperature is the measure of Specific heat. 

Atmospheric temperature tries to measure the air temperature also known as Ambient air temperature which is measured not directly under the sunlight but normally under shade so that the direct effect of sunlight does not affect the air temperature. 

Importance of Atmospheric temperature :   
Atmospheric temperature affects the moisture available in the air if water is present on the surface of the earth, for example around lakes or rivers if the temperature is higher more evaporation can take place and hence more moisture or humidity will be there in the air. But if the temperature is very cold then over such regions much evaporation will not take place and hence less humidity will be there in the air. Hence simply said temperature increase increases the moisture carrying capacity of the air. But carrying capacity does not mean that moisture will be there for sure. For example in hot desert regions the air will have high moisture carrying capacity due to high temperature but due to desert dry conditions much water is not available for evaporation, hence much moisture might not be there in the air.

Factors affecting temperature : 

1. Latitude is the first factor affecting temperature.  
   1. At the equator the temperature is relatively less because the equator is relatively cloudy, whereas the tropics have more sunshine and hence they are hotter. As we move towards the pole the effect of sun rays become more and more inclined and hence lower temperature.

Geography Class 19

2. Altitude is the second factor that affects the temperature  
   1. Altitude means the vertical height from the surface of the earth upward. The temperature decreases by 1 degree celsius for every increase in height (altitude) by 165 meters.  
   2. All the weather and climate phenomena take place in the troposphere only, they do not take place beyond that.  
   3. The temperature falls is an average of 6 to 6.5 degrees Celsius for every 1 km of height from earth surface. This is also not always constant. This varies along with summer / day time the temperature falls faster with altitude whereas during night / winter it falls slower with altitude.   
   4. This is because the temperature below the tropopause does not vary during day and night or summer or winter. But the surface temperature is higher during the summer or day time and it is lower during winter or night time. So the temperature gradient is more during summer which causes faster temperature fall.  
   5. During summer the temperature falls faster with altitude as compared to during winters.

Land has a lower specific heat than water, because of which if the same amount of heat is falling on the land and the water then the land will get hotter by absorbing the same heat whereas the water will get less warmer. This is also because only a very little depth of the land gets heated directly by the sunlight (few centimeters or meters) whereas in a water body the sunlight might penetrate to good depth (in the oceans this depth can be up to 400 meters). Hence in the oceans the same amount of heat is warming up a larger volume of water and hence lesser temperature rise or fall than land where a lesser volume of land gets heater or cold.  
Specific heat is the heat required to be exchanged (given or taken) for 1 degree change in temperature.

3. Continentality effect  
   1. It means the effect of continental region on the temperature.  
   2. Continentality effect means that places on the earth are closer to the continents and when we are on the continent then places in the interior of the continents behave more extreme with respect to the surrounding temperature or expected temperature. Simply said this means that continental places which are closer to the continent and much interior to the continent will be more hotter than normal during summers and more colder than normal during winters especially in the continental interiors away from the coast.  
   3. This is known as the continentality effect or the effect of land.   
   4. Hence continentality has the severing effect. If it is hot it will make it hotter and if it is cold it becomes colder.  
4. Maritime (oceanicity) effect  
   1. It means the effect of the oceanic region on the temperature.  
   2. The maritime effect or the oceanicity effect is that the places away from continents in open oceans (when we are talking of oceans only) or places near to the coast lines away from the continental interior. (when we are talking of continents only) are having a moderated temperature due to the oceans effect which means during summer season such places will be not so hot whereas during winter season such places will be not so cold.  
   3. This is known as the moderating effect of the oceans.  
   4. It has a moderating effect on temperature.  
5. Effect of ocean currents on temperature  
   1. An Ocean current is a unidirectional long distance large volume slow round the year movement of ocean water (in this case surface ocean water). If the water is moving from a colder region (like poles) to a warmer region (like tropics) then we call it a cold current because it is carrying cold water and will make the destination region (tropical region in this case) cooler. The warm current is just the opposite of a cold current.  
   2. Hence simply said cold currents make their destination region cooler whereas warm currents make their destination regions warmer.  
6. Air masses  
   1. An air mass is a large homogeneous packet of air having somewhat uniform characteristics of humidity and temperature. Hence such a large packet of air over a cold region would generally have a colder temperature and would be known as a cold air mass similarly over the hotter region the if the air mass is formed it would have a hotter temperature and would be known as hotter or warmer air mass.  
   2. Hence if a colder air mass moves to a less cooler region it will turn the region more cooler than it was and similarly the hotter air mass can make a new region warmer than it was.  
7. Slope  
   1. More sloped surfaces or higher inclination surfaces will cause the spreading of the sunlight and hence less intense sunlight and hence cooler temperatures.  
8. Shelter  
   1. Where the sunlight is not falling, those places will be cooler  
9. Aspect  
   1. Aspect means which side of the mountains will get sunlight and which sides never get sunlight falling on them.   
   2. For example due to the aspect effect, southern slopes of himalayas generally get the sunlight during the day whereas northern slopes of himalayas generally do not get sunlight due to the aspect effect.  
10. Effect of Natural Vegetation  
    1. Natural vegetation has a moderating effect because in summers when the sunlight is falling it slows down the sunlight and it keeps relatively colder. During extreme cold conditions in the night time vegetation also releases carbon dioxide and whatever radiation is released from the surface also gets trapped and they will keep the surrounding warm.  
11. The effect of different type of surfaces  
    1. Albedo  
       1. Darker  
          1. Relatively warmer  
          2. Absorb more heat  
          3. Less albedo.  
       2. Lighter  
          1. Cooler  
          2. Reflect back more heat  
          3. Higher albedo.  
    2. Wet / Dry  
       1. Wetter surfaces  
          1. Moderating  
       2. Drier surfaces  
          1. Severing

These are the various factors affecting temperature.

### Representing Temperature

An Isotherm is a line drawn on the map connecting places having the same temperature. Hence for example 25 deg celsius isotherm will pass through places having the same temperature. One the same map at one given time we can have different isotherms connecting different places having different temperatures. But no two isotherms on the same map at the same time can cross the same place, which means isotherms cannot intersect on the map.

#### Characteristics of Isotherms

1. The isotherms in general are parallel to the latitude (not always) if other factors affecting temperature are not considered. As we 

As we go from equator to pole the temperature decreases.

Heading 5 : Reasons for bending of Isotopes ?

1\.  Due to continentality effect isotherms in the summer season are bent towards the pole in the summer season.

Simply said during summer when we go from ocean to continent along the isotherm, the isotherms bends towards pole.

In Northern hemisphere During winter due to continentality the isotherms bend towards the Equator.

Similarly we can conclude that during the winters due to the continentality effect the isotherms bend towards the Equator. Simply said during winter when we move from ocean to continent along an isotherm, the isotherm bends towards equator.

Asia has more extreme continentality than North America in the northern hemisphere. Snap : 2:15:20 Class 19\.  The summer extreme temperature around asia is found around western asia africa region somewhere around labia. The maximum temperature ever measured is around 55 degree celsius. The minimum temperature measured is \-85 degrees celsius in cyberia. The average temperature of the whole earth is 15 degrees celsius.

*Which season in the northern hemisphere is more extreme ?* : **Winter** Hence winter in the northern hemisphere is more extreme and hence isotherm bending also in winter is more extreme in the northern hemisphere. Hence January isotherms bend more in the northern hemisphere than in June / July in the northern hemisphere. 2:23:30 (two images)

### Temperature Range

Temperature range is the difference between the maximum and minimum temperature observed on the earth at a given place. Hence there can be two kind of temperature ranges 

1. Day and night temperature range  
   1. Also called as Diurnal temperature range  
2. Summer and winter temperature range  
   1. Also called as Annual temperature range

#### Places having maximum and minimal Diurnal & Annual temperature range

Equatorial regions have minimum Diurnal and Annual temperature range of 3 degree celsius temperature range. The day temperature is sampled at the hottest time which is 2:30 PM and the night time temperature is sampled at the coldest time which is 4:00 AM before morning twilight. The annual temperature range of summer is 28 deg celsius and winter is 25 deg celsius. 2:31:52

Maximum temperature range places  
The diurnal maximum temperature range is generally found in Tropical Desert where the day (hottest) temperature is around 45 degree celsius and the night time (coldest) temperature is around 25 degree celsius giving a diurnal temperature range of 20 degree celsius.  
The annual maximum temperature range is generally found in Eurasian continental regions especially around cyberia regions. Between summer and winter the temperature range is very high where the summer average temperature is 10 degrees celsius and the winter average temperature is \-50 degrees celsius giving a range of 60 degrees celsius.

### Temperature Inversion:

This is a vertical temperature phenomenon. What is vertical temperature inversion ?  
Temperature inversion is a special phenomenon seen vertically in the atmosphere with respect to temperature. This is opposite to the normal lapse rate condition. In the normal lapse rate condition as one goes vertically high in the atmosphere temperature tends to decrease. Opposite to this when one goes vertically high during temperature inversion conditions in the atmosphere, the temperature tends to increase with height.

#### Types of temperature inversion in the atmosphere 

The different types of temperature inversions experiences include

1. Radiation inversion (normally found in the planes)  
2. Subsidence inversion (normally found in the valleys or between mountains or hill)  
3. Marine inversion (found in coastal areas)  
4. Frontal inversion (found along fronts formed between air masses) 

Image 5:17:02  
Conditions for radiation inversion : 

1. It takes place only during Long cold nights  
   1. During long cold nights the ground surface radiates most of the heat that it has absorbed throughout the day. Because of this the ground surface tends to become very cold.  
   2. Hence the air in contact with the ground surface also tends to become cooler whereas the air above this lower air. 5:22:11 does not become cold due to the ground cooling. Hence this way we find that the lower air is cooler than the upper air and hence temperature inversion.  
   3. This is known as Radiation inversion.  
   4. One more condition for radiation inversion is a clear 5:24:30 upper sky with no clouds. Because clouds can reflect back the radiated heat back to the earth surface and hence earth surface will again be heated. No radiation so no inversion.  
   5. The third condition is no strong winds near the earth surface otherwise the cold air near the ground would be carried away and hence no inversion condition. 5:29:45  
2. Valley Inversion or Subsidence inversion 5:30:16  
   1. This is a cold night or winter phenomenon in the hills. Snowfall might be there in the hills 5:31:26 and because of that what could happen is if there is any air near the snow this air might become cold 5:32:09 and hence it will become dense and it will subside to the valley region 5:32:39 and fill up the valley region with cold air and whatever warmer air in the valley will be lifted up. 5:33:51   
   2. 5:34:49 In this case during cold nights or winter nights in the upper parts of the hills the surfaces become very cold. Hence the air over these upper cold surfaces also becomes cold & dense and hence subside to the valleys. 5:36:51  
   3. If any warmer air is present in the valley, the colder denser air replaces it by lifting the warmer air above, hence now colder air in the valley and the lighter warmer air is uplifted. Hence *Valley Inversion*.  
   4. Valley inversion can lead to frost conditions in the valley which if prolonged can be harmful for crops. Hence farmers normally grow different crops not in the deepest parts of the valley but on the sides of the hill slopes to avoid such frost damage. 5:41:41 \- Subsidence inversion. 5:42:16 5:44:06  
   5. The subsidence inversion is also seen when between two hilly regions the valley air remains trapped and cools. Sometimes from the other side of the hill warmer air might come warmed due to rise and compression over the hill and this warmer lighter air might suppress the cooler denser valley air and might continue to move over such valley air as shown. Hence the cold valley air subsides creating a valley inversion or subsidence inversion as shown. 5:47:15 5:52:00 5:52:44  
3. Marine Inversion  
   1. 5:56:31 5:59:39 In marine inversion takes place normally during the end of winter when the land air becomes relatively warm and tends to rise up. Whereas the ocean does not become so warm (because of slow heating and cooling) because there is cool marine air over the ocean surface which tends to spread over the land (coastal area) causing the previous warmer coastal air to rise. This is marine inversion which brings fresh air to the coastal region even when the winter's end.  
4. Frontal inversion  
   1. This will be covered along with air masses and fronts.

##### The effect of inversion

1. Inversion causes the colder air to stay near the ground and hence create fog or dew (water droplets on the ground), frost (frozen dew) type of conditions.  
2. It does not allow the lower air colder air to rise and hence increase pollution conditions.  
3. Marine inversion can cause fog on the coast and hence affect navigation at the port.  
4. Some frost is good for winter crops but too much extended period of frost adversely affects vegetation and crops.

# Pressure

Pressure is force experienced over an area. Atmospheric pressure is defined as the weight of the overlying column of air at any place. Normally atmospheric pressure 6:13:14 is measured and talked about at mean sea level which we call as normal atmospheric pressure which is the weight of air column over the 1 unit area of ocean surface. 6:14:49. Atmospheric pressure acts in all directions at a given place just like the pressure inside the balloon filled with air acts in all directions from inside on the balloon surface and not only downwards towards the ground. 6:17:17 

##### How to measure the atmospheric pressure

We use the device known as the Barometer and the normal atmospheric pressure is around 1013.2 millibars (where millibars is the unit of atmospheric pressure). This is what we call as Normal atmospheric pressure at mean sea level.

##### High and low pressure conditions

Generally high pressure and low pressures are not measured against a standard or average value. They are indeed compared against each other and derive the high / low pressure.

### How High and Low pressure conditions are created ?

6:27:41 6:29:27 6:30:55 6:31:44 6:32:50 6:34:46 6:35:22 6:36:30 6:39:21  
In the atmosphere any phenomena where heating or cooling is involved we call it Thermal phenomena. If only movement is involved without heating or cooling we call it a Mechanical phenomena.  
6:42:10 6:44:43 6:47:22 6:48:44 6:51:01 6:53:06 6:54:11 6:55:42 6:56:43 6:57:51

|  | Vertical | Horizontal | Heat |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Low Pressure | Out | In | Hot |
| High Pressure | In | Out | Cool |

7:00:07 7:01:51 7:02:47 7:04:15 7:05:12 7:06:43 7:07:23 7:08:09 7:08:30 7:09:39 7:12:03  
As the atmospheric pressure at the sea level is 1013.2 millibars due to the air column. As we go higher the air column reduces and the atmospheric pressure goes on decreasing in absolute terms 7:14:08 at the rate of nearly 3.5 millibars for every 30 meters. Hence when we reach near the tropopause the pressure will never be same or similar to the earth surface pressure and would always be low. Hence when we say high or low pressure near tropopause this is due to comparing the two pressures near tropopause. (region 2 and region 4 being compared). 7:17:06 and this high and low pressure in the upper atmosphere is not with respect to or compared to the surface pressure conditions. Because surface pressure conditions will always be higher than the upper atmospheric pressure conditions. 7:19:00. Pressure is always compared at the same horizontal level and not compared vertically. 7:28:55

Horizontally seen air is moving from High pressure to Low pressure. The movement of air from high pressure to low pressure is known as Wind. 7:30:46. Horizontally seen the movement of air from high pressure regions to low pressure regions is known as **Wind**. Simply said, wind always moves from high pressure to low pressure. The difference between the pressure between two regions is called **Pressure difference** where pressure difference (PD) is equal to high pressure \- low pressure. The pressure difference is the direction of high pressure to low pressure. 7:35:46 7:37:32 7:38:17 7:39:26 7:40:20 7:42:02 7:43:30 7:44:46 7:46:30

In these two cases as we see the pressure difference between AC and AB 7:51:14 is the same but the rate of change of pressure between AB is slower than the rate of change of pressure between AC. Because the wind is moving because of change in pressure, hence wherever the pressure will change faster there the wind will also move faster. Hence in this case the speed of wind AB is slower than the speed of wind AC.  
The rate of change of pressure discussed above is known as **Pressure gradient** which is defined as pressure difference per unit distance. Hence if we calculate the pressure gradient AB   
PG (AB) \= 20 / 500 kms \= 0.04 mb/kms and PG (AC) \= 20 / 100 kms \= 0.2 mb/kms. 7:58:10. Since the pressure gradient between AC is higher, hence wind speed between AC will also be higher.

| *Pressure difference tells us about the direction of wind from higher pressure to lower pressure. Pressure gradient, which is the rate of change of pressure difference, rather tells us about the speed and the strength of the winds. If the pressure gradient is higher the wind will be faster and stronger.* |

### Movement of winds on the earth’s surface

##### Factors affecting winds

1. Forces causing winds :   
   1. Driving force : driving forces can be understood to be similar to the engine of the car. The engine is the main driving force for the car and the car moves because of the driving coming from the engine.  
      1. For Horizontal air movement : Driving force is the *Pressure gradient force*.  
      2. For Vertical air movement : Driving forces are *Pressure gradient force and Gravitational force.* The gravitational force will cause lighter air to rise and denser air to sink. Both of them are effects of gravitational force.  
   2. Steering force : steering force is like the effect of steering for the car. Hence it gives the direction to the wind, especially when the wind is bending or turning. But the steering force alone does not have any effect, which means that if there is no driving force then the steering force cannot turn the wind. Without driving force the steering force has no effect.  
      1. Coriolis Force :   
         1. Coriolis force is basically the effect of earth’s rotation which when combined with the wind's movement tends to create an illusion of an additional movement specially a turning movement which in reality does not take place and hence is more or less an apparent movement.  
         2. Apparent movements are movements which seem to be taking place but actually do not take place. For example when we are traveling in a moving car the trees on the ground apparently seem to be moving backward, but actually they are not moving. Rather it is the relative motion between the car and the trees which make it seem like the trees are apparently moving. 5:41:06  
         3. Coriolis force is also an apparent force which causes an apparent turning of the winds (or any object traveling a substantial distance on the earth like aircrafts, missiles, ocean currents etc.).   
         4. This apparent turning is such that the objects in the northern hemisphere seem to turn to the right 5:43:57 and objects in the southern hemisphere seem to deflect to the left. 5:45:00  
         5. But in reality (when seen from outside the rotating earth & earth’s atmosphere system) there is no actual deflection as the deflection is an apparent effect / illusion of earth’s rotation.  
         6. We know that the equatorial locations rotate at the fastest speed because they have to cover the biggest circle in 24 hours 5:49:19. 5:50:10 but if we take other locations along the same longitude 5:50:43 each at a relatively higher latitude than the previous then the rotational speeds of each of them will go on decreasing because they would be doing a smaller circle each as we go to the higher latitudes. Therefore the speed of 5 \< 4 \< 3 \< 2 \< 1 5:54:23 5:58:05 6:01:52  
         7. Simply said, the coriolis effect is an illusion effect which causes a visible bending of objects moving over long distances on the earth surface towards the right in the northern hemisphere and towards the left in the southern hemisphere 6:08:25 in the direction of movement.   
         8. The other characteristics of coriolis force :   
            1. It only affects wind direction but does not affect the wind speed.  
            2. Coriolis force itself does get affected by speed. Hence higher the speed, higher will seem to be the bending which could also be said as higher the speed higher the coriolis force.  
            3. At the equator the coriolis force is zero and it will go on increasing towards the pole. Coriolis force effect is maximum at the pole.  
            4. It is the effect of the earth's rotation.  
      2. Frictional Force : 6:16:00 Frictional force is the effect of friction of the earth surface and the air near it. Hence as we go higher and higher (altitude) from the earth surface the friction force effect goes on decreasing. Hence the friction force effect is only near the earth surface (lower troposphere) and not in the upper atmosphere (upper troposphere).  
         1. The friction effect is to slow down the speed of moving objects. This way by slowing down the speed it reduces the coriolis effect. 6:20:54  
         2. Simply said friction tends to oppose coriolis force hence frictional force can be said to be so acting that objects in the northern hemisphere are bent to the left 6:23:52 and objects in the southern hemisphere are bent to right 6:24:15 due to frictional force. 6:24:51.  
         3. It is just opposing coriolis force.  
      3. Centripetal & Centrifugal Force :   
         1. These forces come into play only when the wind is moving horizontally circular on the earth surface. Then the centripetal force acts inwards and the centrifugal force acts outwards. Because of which the wind neither goes in nor outwards and just continues to move circular.

Conclusion :   
Coriolis force bends to right in the northern hemisphere and to left in the southern hemisphere and the frictional force opposes the coriolis force.

### Winds on the earth

##### Non Rotating Earth

Therefore no coriolis force effect 6:35:23 6:36:48 6:37:22 6:38:10 6:39:15 6:40:10 6:41:17 6:41:30 6:42:20 6:43:06 6:43:38 6:44;04 (expected wind in non rotating earth) 6:45:48

#### Rotating Earth

This means there is the coriolis force effect and the frictional force effect.

##### Geostrophic winds

Geostrophic winds are upper atmosphere winds blowing just below the tropopause in a broadly west to east direction. Their formation is as discussed below. 7:06:00 Only upper atmosphere winds are shown. 7:07:06 7:07:55 7:09:25

1. Reason why geostrophic wind move from equator to pole above tropopause is high and low pressures created above equator and pole  
2. The tropopause region above the equator is colder and the tropopause region above the pole is relatively warmer. So thermal low pressure and mechanical low pressure conditions exist at the pole and thermal high pressure and mechanical high pressure conditions exist over the equator's tropopause.

7:11:43 7:12:27 7:13:10 7:14:18   
Coriolis force acts to the right of the direction of movement of the object in the northern hemisphere and left in the southern hemisphere. 7:15:40 7:16:14 7:17:20 7:18:07 7:19:03. In the upper atmosphere there is no frictional force effect. 7:21:58 At 30 degree latitude we get a strong west to east moving wind because the pressure gradient force and coriolis force cancel each other. 7:23:25. This west to east upper atmosphere wind is called a **Geostrophic wind**. 7:24:47  
As we find in the diagram of geostrophic winds in the upper atmosphere 

1. The pressure gradient force is from the equator towards the pole.   
2. Because of this PGF upper atmosphere winds start to move from equator towards pole just below the tropopause.  
3. As this wind moves away from the equator, coriolis force starts to act on it and the coriolis force also gradually gets stronger as the winds move away from the equator.  
4. For example in the northern hemisphere (as shown in the diagram) the coriolis force acts to the right of the wind because of this it gradually goes on deflecting the wind to the east and also opposing the pressure gradient force gradually.   
5. Around 30 degree latitude in the upper atmosphere it is observed in reality that the coriolis force becomes equal and opposite to the pressure gradient force and starts acting towards the equator. Hence because the PGF and coriolis force are now exactly opposite to each other and also the coriolis force becomes equal in magnitude to the pressure gradient force, hence they cancel out each other. Therefore now the winds move neither northward nor southward but rather they start moving west to east in the upper atmosphere above 30 degree latitude. These west to east moving winds are known as Geostrophic winds.

7:45:53 7:46:30  7:47:03  7:47:40 7:48:30 7:48:45 7:49:21 7:49:44 7:52:30 

On the rotating earth at the equatorial region near the earth surface we have a thermal low pressure from where winds from tropical region 30 degree latitude will try to come towards the equator and vertically rise 7:55:09 towards tropopause. Near the tropopause these winds start moving again towards the pole. Due to earth’s rotation they become geostrophic winds moving west to east above 30 degree latitude near tropopause (upper atmosphere). 7:59:53 8:00:21 8:01:28 8:01:38 8:02:01 8:02:20

Geography Class 22  
5:07:52 5:08:45 5:11:48 5:12:20 5:13:12 5:14:47 

On the rotating earth (hence coriolis force effect considered) at the equator we have a low pressure condition where the winds move horizontally inward and vertically outward reaching up to the tropopause above the equator from here the wind starts moving polewards but due to coriolis force effect below the tropopause around 30 degree latitude the winds become geostrophic winds these geostrophic winds can neither go poleward nor equatorward also not above the tropopause (cross the tropopause) and the west to east movement with continuous accumulation of wind in the region makes eastward and westward movement also difficult. Hence the only possible way the wind can move now is downward that means toward the earth surface. Hence the winds start moving this way reaching the surface of the earth around 30 degree latitude, from where the winds get bifurcated partly pole wards and partly equatorwards. This way around 30 degrees near the surface of the earth a mechanical condition of wind moving vertically inwards and horizontally outwards is created hence causing the mechanical high pressure region around the 30 degree latitude like a belt. Similar was the low pressure belt along the equator. The part of the winds reaching the equator complete a cell in the atmosphere known as **Hadley cell**. 

5:27:04 5:29:03 5:30:18 5:31:33 5:34:10 5:34:43 5:47:18 5:47:30 5:48:30 5:49:40 

While the Hadley cell gets formed between 0 and 30 degree latitude simultaneously at the polar region near the earth surface we have a thermal high pressure condition because of the region being very cold. From this surface polar thermal high pressure winds move towards the 60 degree sub polar region, where they meet winds coming from the 30 degree subtropical region. Hence at 60 degree surface winds move horizontally inward and vertically outward hence creating a surface mechanical low pressure at subpolar region. The polar surface high pressure creates a corresponding mechanical upper atmosphere low pressure whereas the subpolar surface mechanical low pressure creates a corresponding upper atmosphere mechanical high pressure as shown in the diagram. 5:57:48 Because of these pressure regions over the polar subpolar zone the polar cell is created with primarily surface winds moving from polar high pressure to subpolar low pressure. Also due to pressure regions created over 60 degree latitude and 30 degree latitude and winds moving from subtropical high pressure belt to subpolar low pressure belt over the earth surface finally the ferrel cell is created.

This way in any hemisphere of the earth (northern or southern) there are four pressure belts created (belt means surrounding the earth for that latitude) 

1. Equatorial low pressure belt  
2. Subtropical high pressure belt  
3. Subpolar low pressure belt  
4. Polar high pressure belt

And between these belts on the earth surface winds move from high pressure to low pressure contributing to the formation of three wind cells at the planetary level namely Hedley cell, ferrel cell and polar cell in each hemisphere. This theory of planetary wind circulation is known as the **Tricellular model** of wind circulation and also known as primary atmospheric circulation.  
6:05:36 6:05:45.  
The three cells of the primary atmospheric circulation have three important surface winds blowing between subtropical high and equatorial low, subtropical high to subpolar low and polar high to subpolar low. These three surface winds are also known as planetary winds or primary surface winds. We are most concerned about these three surface winds because that’s where we live.

### The three primary surface winds

Wind between 0 and 30 degrees :   
Also known as the planetary winds. They are part of primary atmospheric circulations. 6:12:50 6:16:04 6:17:02 6:19:11 6:19:50 6:20:55 6:22:10 6:22:50 6:23:35 6:24:30 6:26:13  
From the subtropical high pressure region on the surface of earth winds move towards the equatorial low pressure region on the surface of the earth . These winds under the coriolis force effect as well as slight frictional force effect ultimately take westward bend in both hemispheres (towards slight right in the northern hemisphere and towards slight left in southern hemisphere) 6:30:30.

Wind between 30 and 60 degrees :   
6:33:00   
Between 30 and 60 degrees the winds move from 30 degree subtropical high (direction is always from the origin of wind) to 60 degree subpolar low moving polewards in both the hemispheres. These winds in both the hemispheres will bend slightly to the east due to their respective coriolis force deflection. 6:36:03 

Wind between 60 degrees and 90 degrees :   
6:40:52

Naming of surface planetary winds  
The rule for naming winds is : Winds are named on the basis of direction from which they come 6:44:43. This is the rule for naming winds 6:47:25 6:48:48 6:50:20 6:50:46 6:51:05 6:52:20 6:53:30 6:53:55 6:54:03 6:54:30 6:55:30

We will first complete the pressure as the second element of weather and climate before talking further about winds which is the third element in our list of weather and climate.

Pressure

1. High and low pressure  
2. Pressure difference  
   1. Pressure difference gives us wind direction  
3. Pressure gradient  
   1. Pressure gradient gives us wind strength and speed.  
4. Pressure belts  
   1. 7 pressure belts on the earth  
      1. Polar high, Subpolar low, tropic high and equatorial low.

First let’s finish pressure belts

##### Shifting of pressure belts

7:21:16 7:23:48  
Equatorial low pressure belt is created mainly due to the heating of the sun which remains around the equator round the year and over the equator on the equinox days. Hence around the equinox period the equatorial low will be exactly (march and september) over the equator and hence the subtropical high will be exactly over the 30 degree latitude whereas the subpolar low will be exactly over the 60 degree latitude 7:27:40 on the equinox days. 7:28:50 7:29:53

With the change in season as we move from equinox to the solstice for example from march to june, the sun will move northwards towards the tropic of cancer. Hence the heating due to the sun will also shift northwards around june and hence the equatorial low pressure belt will also shift northwards 7:35:40 as shown in the june diagram. As the equatorial low pressure belt shifts northward, the hedley cell, ferrel cell and polar cell will shift northwards in both the hemisphere from march to june. This way the surface planetary winds also shift especially on their margins. This shifting of pressure belts continues with the shifting of the sun round the year for example from june to september the sun will again shift south hence all the pressure belts will shift south. Further from September to December the sun will further shift south (after september equinox) towards the tropic of Capricorn and hence all the pressure belts will also shift south and so will the planetary surface winds. From December to March the sun will shift northwards from the tropic of Capricorn to equator and hence all the pressure belts and planetary surface winds will also shift northward. Hence this is how the pressure belts and the associated planetary winds shift round the year. The shifting of the planetary winds does not broadly effect in the middle regions of the planetary wind zones.but due to shifting the winds on the margin of the planetary wind regions the given latitude places might experience change of planetary winds during different seasons. 7:47:15  
For example when we see along 45 degree latitude round the year the wind will be westerlies wind 7:48:03 because it is in the middle of the planetary wind region.  
But when we see the 30 degree latitude line 7:49:30 7:50:40 7:53:10

This shifting of the pressure belts and wind belts takes place by maximum 5 to 10 degree latitude.

Geography Class 23

5:08:30  
The pressure belt is a continuous encircling region around the whole earth having a high or a low pressure condition.   
The pressure cells will be localized pressure regions over the earth surface due to local conditions. They might be high or low pressure regions. 5:16:33. 

##### Formation of seasonal pressure cells

5:18:11 5:18:50 13:25 15:37 16:08  
Sub polar region will become warm in summer and hence thermally a low pressure condition will try to prevail 17:30 . In the subpolar low pressure region is supported by both low pressure thermal and low pressure mechanical will aid.

##### Subtropical high region pressure belt condition 

The Sub-tropical region has a mechanically created high pressure belt. The subtropical region in summers have very hot temperatures specially over the continents due to continentality effect also (severing) though ocean temperature will not be very hot due to moderating maritime effect of the oceans. Hence over the continents 23:03 in subtropical region a localized low pressure region is created known as subtropical low pressure cell 23:52 as shown in the diagram below. Due to subtropical low pressure cell formation over the continent the subtropical high pressure belt gets broken and parts of it remain over the oceans now forming localized pressure cells over the oceans known as subtropical high pressure cells.29:49 30:17 31:08 31:47 32:42 35:07

Pressure belts in the Winter condition :   
During winter the polar high pressure belt region and the equatorial low pressure belt region behave the same as they were behaving during summer. During the winters the subtropical regions which are having a mechanical high also remain relatively cold during winter, the colder subtropical conditions support the existing mechanical high pressure conditions. So the subtropical high pressure belt remains. 43:00 

Pressure belt and pressure cells in subpolar regions :   
The subpolar region has a mechanically created low pressure belt. 46:24 47:35 49:59 50:50 52:14 54:32. But during the winter season the subpolar region becomes extremely cold over the continents due to the severing effect of continents, hence a thermal high pressure region is created over the continent forming a high pressure cell and breaking the subpolar low pressure belt. This newly formed subpolar high pressure cell remains over the continent whereas the broken parts of the subpolar low pressure belts now form subpolar low pressure cells over the oceans. Such a cell over the atlantic in the subpolar region is known as icelandic low and over the pacific is known as aleutian low.  
Hence all aspects related to pressure are completed.

We will continue with the winds part 

### WINDS

We have already done the primary atmospheric circulation which has three atmospheric cells which are hadley, ferrel and polar cell. 1:15:47 1:16:38 1:17:28   
Planetary surface winds

1. Tropical easterlies  
2. Westerlies  
3. Polar easterlies

The upper atmospheric winds are (just below the tropopause)

1. 1:18:23 Rossby waves  
   1. Jet streams  
      1. Mostly created from Geostrophic winds

In addition to these primary winds, we do have some other surface winds.

The first surface winds we see are planetary winds. The special thing about these winds is that in a given latitude we always know which wind is blowing. 1:21:41  1:23:54

Properties of big river

1. Flows between two ends  
2. Flows in the same direction  
3. Flows long distance  
4. Round the year

In a river we have a 

1. Primary flow (main river flow)   
   1. Ganga is a east flowing river (for example)  
      1. We call Ganga the Easterly river.  
   2. Brahmaputra in india is a west flowing river  
2. Secondary flow  
   1. Whirlpools in brahmaputra and ganga  
   2. Within primary flow of the river  
3. Tertiary flow  
   1. Within primary flow  
   2. Might not be in secondary  
   3. Examples are waterfalls, rapids, over large stones  
   4. This is because of non uniform surface features of river channel

Planetary winds are also called Primary surface winds.  
The secondary winds on the earth are

1. Whirlpools  
   1. Two kinds \- Clockwise and anticlockwise  
   2. Created due to local pressure conditions  
      1. High pressure  
         1. Anti cyclonic  
      2. Low pressure  
         1. Cyclonic  
2. Monsoon  
   1. It is created over india  
   2. There are secondary because they are not global and they are also not so local  
3. Other ocean-atmosphere coupled phenomenons  
   1. Examples EL-NINO, LA-NINA, Indian ocean dipoles.

The tertiary winds on the earth are

1. These are created due to non-uniform features (un-even) on earth’s surface  
2. Examples  
   1. Land and sea difference  
   2. Mountains and valleys  
   3. Colder and warmer regions  
      1. Warmer regions gives winds such as Loo  
      2. Colder regions give winds such as cold waves.

### Primary Surface Winds

On the earth we find 6 primary surface winds three in both hemispheres as discussed below. These primary surface winds cover the whole surface of the earth and continue to blow round the year in their respective latitude regions. They are part of the tricellular model as discussed earlier. The three primary surface winds in each hemisphere are

##### Tropical Easterlies

1. They are created mainly due to the equatorial low pressure belt which is thermally formed due to the sun's heating directly.  
2. This is the strongest of the three primary surface winds and continuously blows over the tropical region round the year. Due to their strong predictable nature they were earlier used by trading ships for sailing in medieval and ancient periods. Hence also called Trade winds. 2:10:09  
3. In the equatorial low region near the surface they tend to converge from both the hemisphere and vertically rise towards the tropopause. Hence on the surface equatorial region the winds are relatively weaker and hence  2:12:56 2:13:45 2:14:30   
4. This very weak wind is known as Doldrums region.2:16:05  
5. The trade winds are otherwise strong winds and due to high temperature they have high moisture holding capacity because of which they create cloudy conditions over the equatorial low pressure region. This is why the equatorial region is not the hottest region because it is cloudy also.

##### Westerlies

1. Westerlies blow between 30 to 60 degree latitudes  
2. They are created mainly between the two mechanical pressure belts namely subtropical high pressure belt and subpolar low pressure belts  
3. But these pressure belts are not very strong specially over the continents 2:20:39 For example   
   1. In summer over the continent we have the subpolar low pressure belt and subtropical low pressure cell. Hence in the region in between (30 to 60 degree latitude) the pressure gradient will be very low and hence 2:22:55 the westerly winds will be weak. 2:23:15 . *Hence simply said in Summers over the continents westerlies are weak*.  
   2. During winter over the continent 2:24:25 both at 30 degree and 60 degree we have high pressure conditions which are subtropical high pressure belt and subpolar high pressure cell, hence the pressure gradient will be low. Hence westerly winds over this region 2:25:25 will again be weak. *Hence simply said in Winters over the continents westerlies are weak.*  
   3. So simply said *Westerly winds over the continent round the year are weak.*  
   4. Hence westerly winds are generally relatively stronger round the year over the oceans.  
   5. Hence westerly winds are generally stronger over the southern hemisphere and relatively weaker over the northern hemisphere and hence in the southern hemisphere they are known as   
      1. 40 degree latitudes \- Roaring 40’s  
      2. 50 degree latitudes \- Furious 50’s  
      3. 60 degree latitudes \- Shrieking 60’s  
   6. Due to the shifting of the pressure belts also some regions experience the change between the westerlies and tropical easterlies or westerlies and polar easterlies during summer and winter season.

##### Polar easterlies

1. Polar easterlies are created due to the thermal high pressure belt near the poles. Because Antarctica is a continent and the arctic is an ocean. Hence polar easterlies are stronger over the southern hemisphere. (due to continentality and maritime effects)

These 3 primary winds carry the heat from the hotter tropical regions towards the cooler polar regions hence maintaining the earth’s horizontal heat budget.

### Tertiary winds

There are three major group of tertiary winds. The tertiary winds are also known as the Local winds. The three major groups are

##### Mountain and valley winds

2:37:37 2:39:38   
Breeze means slow moving air. During night time the upper parts of the mountains become cool, the air also becomes cool & dense, it starts to flow down the slope as mountain wind or mountain breeze. During day time the winds from the valley become relatively warmer and flow up the mountain slopes as they turn lighter and hence are known as the valley breeze. The valley winds can create clouds in the upper part of the mountain and cause rains during hotter days. Whereas the mountain breeze creates foggy and frosty conditions in the valleys.

##### Land and sea breeze / winds 

Geography class 24  
6:20 7:30 7:44 10:03 11:03 11:35   
Ocean breeze brings clouds and rain to the land. The land breeze brings the winds from the land to the ocean and the pollution from the land to the sea and over the ocean it might cause clouds and rains.

##### Hot and Cold winds

Hot winds are winds which are created over relatively hotter regions and move towards cooler regions. Cold winds are winds which are created over relatively cooler regions and move towards hotter regions making such regions relatively cooler. These hot winds are also known as Warm winds.  
These hot or warm winds or cold winds are locally created in different parts of the world and named locally also. Some of the major warm winds of the world are

1. FOHN (Alpine mountains) European regions  
2. Chinook (Rocky mountains)  
3. Sirocco winds  
   1. Also known as Khamsin, gibli 23:12  
4. Harmattan  
   1. Also known as Doctor winds in west africa  
5. Santa Ana   
   1. Wind in north america around the california coast  
6. Zonda  
   1. This is in south america  
7. Loo  
   1. India

25:00 to 25:30  
The examples of cold winds are

1. MISTRAL (Europe)  
2. BORA (Europe)  
3. Blizzard   
   1. Northern polar region.  
4. Pamparo  
   1. South america  
5. Southern busters  
   1. Australia

# Humidity

Humidity is the presence of water vapor in the air. Water vapor is gaseous H2O at normal temperature like room temperature. Steam is gaseous H2O at boiling temperature. Every place on earth normally would have some water vapor at normal temperature. Steam is gaseous H2O at boiling point.

##### Feel

Humidity gives us a feeling of dampness or wetness.

##### Measure

Humidity is measured using a hygrometer.

##### Represent atmospheric humidity

There are 3 different ways 

1. Absolute humidity  
   1. It is the measure of the net weight of water vapor in a given volume of air which is shown as gm/m3  
   2. It tells us about the total weight of water vapor present or simply said the moisture present in the air.  
   3. The water vapor or humidity present in the air is decided mainly   
      1. Temperature of the air.  
      2. Moisture availability

   If we consider water availability is ample in the region then the air temperature decides how much moisture can be present in the air. More the temperature, the more the moisture holding capacity provided water availability is there.

   4. Absolute humidity tells us about moisture or humidity availability.  
2. Relative humidity  
   1. Relative humidity is the ratio between actual amount of water vapor present (availability) divided by maximum amount of water vapor that can be present at that given temperature.  
   2. Let us a say 1:01:10 1:03:10 \=\> 1:06:08  
   3. Relative humidity is measured in percentage.  
   4. Importance of relative humidity is with respect to moisture saturation. 1:13:01  
   5. The air at a given temperature is holding the maximum humidity that it can hold, this is called Moisture saturation or humidity saturation.  
   6. Humidity saturation is nothing but 100% relative humidity.  
   7. 1:16:44  
   8. When the available moisture is greater than the moisture holding capacity at that temperature, the excess moisture is released in the air as condensed solid or liquid water in the form of dew, fog, mist, clouds and frost.  
   9. Hence simply said 100% relative humidity is also known as Saturation temperature or saturation point of air. Any further decrease in temperature leads to dew formation. Hence this temperature is known as Dew point.

Hence any further cooling beyond dew point leads to condensation. Condensation is when a gas is converted to liquid. The relative humidity tells you about the probability of condensation. Hence if relative humidity is 95% then probability of condensation such as cloud, fog etc is very high. On the other hand if the relative humidity is 50% or 40% then probability of cloud formation or rainfall is low.

3. Specific humidity  
   1. It is the measure of the weight of the actual amount of water vapor present per unit weight of air.  
   2. It is represented as gm/kg : grams of water vapor per kg of air.

### Atmospheric condensation

Atmospheric condensation is the process of liquid or solid formation in the atmosphere from the water vapor condensation. This condensation in the atmosphere takes place when the following conditions are fulfilled. 

1. Dew temperature or Dew point.  
2. There is a surface available for water to condense upon.  
   1. Ground surface  
   2. Water attracting solid particle surface  
      1. Hygroscopic particles. (Dust particles) \- Floating dust particles

##### Types of condensation on Ground surface

1. Dew Drops  
2. Frost  
   1. Frozen dew drops

##### Types of condensation on Dust particles

1. Hygroscopic condensation will give us  
   1. Fog  
   2. Mist (lighter than fog)  
   3. Clouds

1:55:10 1:58:00  
All the cloud formation is due to floating dust particles.

# Clouds

Clouds are formed due to upper atmosphere condensation and only the clouds lead to precipitation (precipitation covered later) Hence we cover different types of clouds here. Cloud formation takes place around these hygroscopic particles in the upper atmosphere. Small water droplets are formed which can continue to float in air because they are very small. A collected bunch of such small water droplets is known as clouds. Hence simply said are very small water droplets floating in air as a group in the upper atmosphere. Start from 2:07:58

### Types of clouds

Clouds are classified on the basis of 

1. Height (from the sea level)  
   1. High : If the clouds are more than 8 kms \- CIRRUS  
   2. Medium : if the clouds are 2 to 8 kms \- ALTO  
   3. Low : Less than 2 kms \- STRATUS  
2. Spread  
   1. Vertical : CUMULUS  
   2. Horizontal : STRATUS  
3. Raininess  
   1. If they are rainy \- NIMBUS

Clouds like a human being have two parts to their name. The first part is generally with respect to height. The second part is generally with respect to the spread. If it is neither horizontal nor vertical it would be nothing. If the first part is raininess then the second part is height. So there are a total of 10 types of clouds. All these clouds are the result of condensation around dust particles.

##### Difference between Vertical and Horizontal cloud

Vertical clouds generally give heavier rains and horizontal clouds give slower rains. So vertical clouds have higher precipitation and horizontal clouds have lower precipitation.

All these clouds are formed within the troposphere but in addition to the tropospheric clouds there are two more types of clouds we have

1. The Polar stratospheric clouds  
   1. Just formed above the tropopause  
2. Noctilucent clouds  
   1. Formed in mesosphere  
   2. Shines in the night  
   3. Over the poles only  
   4. Doesn’t cause rain

Most of the rains take place due to stratus clouds (low clouds) or the cumulonimbus clouds. For example nimbostratus, stratonimbus, cumulonimbus. Whereas the cirrus clouds, noctilucent clouds, polar stratospheric clouds do not cause rain. The other ones might cause some rain.

Geography Class 25

##### Cloud seeding

In regions where we do no receive rains and want to create artificial rains, in such regions the phenomena of cloud seeding is applied where artificial condensation nuclei (hygroscopic particles around which the droplets form) are released in the region of cloud formation so that induced condensation will take place around such hygroscopic particles leading to formation of clouds and further causing precipitation in the process. Hence this leads to artificial rains. Different chemicals are used for this process, the most common being silver iodide, other elements being potassium iodide (these are iodine aerosols \- (small droplets)) also dry ice, potassium chloride. Sometimes liquid propane is also used. In recent times artificially created electric shocks using drones have also been other methods used for cloud seeding or creating artificial rains.

# Precipitation

Precipitation simply means coming down or settling down. What settles down is the particles floating in the air in the clouds. Condensation in the upper atmosphere gives us clouds. Precipitation in the atmosphere is the process of falling down of small water droplets or frozen water in the clouds which due to certain physical conditions go on to accumulate, become bigger as compared to cloud droplets they go on to become few 1000 times bigger and hence now being bigger in size they fall down towards the surface of the earth. This falling of these water droplets or frozen water is collectively known as precipitation.

##### Types of Forms of precipitation

1. Liquid  
   1. Rains (on the basis of intensity)  
      1. Light rains (Drizzle)  
      2. Mediocre rain   
      3. Heavy rains (Thunderstorm)  
2. Solidified liquid drops  
   1. Sleet (small ice balls)   
   2. Hail (big ice balls)  
3. Solid   
   1. Snow  
      1. Forms as solid and falls as solid  
      2. It is like Flakes

##### How are these formed

These are formed based on cloud temperature or condition. If the cloud temperature is

1. Below freezing temperature  
   1. High latitudes  
   2. Higher altitudes (above mountains)  
   3. Hence in this case we will get Water directly freezes in the clouds forming Snow Flakes  
   4. This is the process of crystallization  
   5. This is not a dew point. Dew point gives clouds and freezing point gives snow.  
   6. 54:50  
   7. Crystallization also required hygroscopic particles. Crystallization of snow also takes place around hygroscopic particles.  
2. Above freezing point in the clouds  
   1. Then by collision and coalescence (joining) of smaller droplets around more hygroscopic particles bigger droplets are formed known as Rain Drops.  
   2. Rain drops require hygroscopic particles for their precipitation. The process is collision and coalescence. 

Dew point is gas to liquid. Water to snow is the freezing point. The common thing between these two formations is the hygroscopic nuclei.

3. Formation of hail and sleet  
   1. Hail and sleet is not the same as snow.  
      1. Hail and sleet are frozen transparent ice balls. Hence they are different from snow in the formation itself.  
   2. Difference between ice and snow  
      1. Ice is frozen droplets and are transparent  
      2. Snow is hexagonal flakes which are not transparent.  
   3. Sleet and hail are simply rain drops around which have frozen. If they remain small frozen droplets they are sleet. Whereas if they become bigger frozen droplets, they are known as hail.

###### *Formation of sleet*

For sleet first rain droplets have to be formed. Consider the cloud condition is above freezing point. Because of this rain drop fell from clouds.1:11:47  1:13:10 

Sleet formation takes place when the cloud is in above freezing temperature zone and hence water droplets or raindrops tend to form and fall. As they continue to fall they come across “below freezing point temperature zone” which might be created below the cloud due to jet streams or other upper air or wind conditions. Passing through such zone the falling droplets freeze into ice balls or frozen ice droplets and fall as such to the ground known as sleet.

##### Formation of Hail

1:29:47 1:32:30 1:34:00 1:39:10 1:41:24 1:42:57  
Similar to sleet formation initially the small falling water droplets might turn into frozen droplets in the below freezing zones below the clouds. Here an additional condition of rising convectional air as shown in the diagram might carry the frozen droplets back into the clouds. This convection might also lead to creation of vertical clouds (like cumulonimbus clouds) which generally assists accumulation of more water around the frozen droplets brought up by convection. This way the size of these frozen droplets might increase with additional water around them. Due to gravity these bigger droplets might again fall back to the below freezing temperature zone and refreeze into bigger ice balls. Due to strong convection, the more this upward carrying process repeats for the frozen and refrozen ice balls, the bigger the ice balls become. This is how the bigger hail is formed.

Hail and sleet formation normally happens not in snowfall regions or during snowfall for example   
Thanks to warmer air convections up to monsoon in most of north and central Indian states like UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, J\&K hail and hail storms occur even in summer season. 

Hail can be seen in tropical, subtropical, low altitude regions.

Absence of water droplets is the reason why hail formation doesn’t take place in polar regions or subpolar regions

### Different Processes causing precipitation

##### Necessary conditions for precipitation

1. Super saturated humidity conditions  
2. Condensation nuclei (something water can accumulate upon)  
   1. Hygroscopic nuclei

2:06:15 2:08:50  
Generally most of the dust particles are in the lower atmosphere and they are generally not there in the upper atmosphere.  
2:10:30

When the lower atmosphere air rich in moisture and dust particles or condensation nuclei rises to the upper atmosphere cloud region this is an ideal condition for precipitation formation.

###### *How many ways can air rise causing precipitation ?*

Air rises in these ways

1. Convergence or converging air  
   1. Equatorial low pressure belt  
      1. That’s why the equator is cloudy. It is rainy.  
   2. Subpolar low pressure belt  
   3. Tropical cyclones  
2. Convectional air  
   1. Hot ground surfaces (thermally low pressure)  
3. Frontal air  
   1. In case of fronts formation in temperate cyclones.  
4. Physically caused rising air (orographically rising)  
   1. In case of air rising along mountain slopes

2:24:00 2:24:58 2:25:40 2:27:05  
Orography means mountain caused. Topography is shape.

Clouds alone cannot cause precipitation. One of these 4 processes is required for precipitation as they carry moisture and condensation nuclei.

Geography class 26

##### Precipitation distribution on earth

###### *General trend*

1. The general trend of precipitation is in general precipitation decreases from equator to pole. This is generally the volume of rainfall.  
2. There is generally more rainfall or precipitation in the coastal regions as compared to the interior regions.  
3. More precipitation over the oceans as compared to over the continents.  
4. In the tropical subtropical regions & closer to the equator regions (5 to 35 degrees latitude) the rainfall or precipitation decreases over the continents when we move from the eastern side of the continent to the western side of the continent. 11:15  
5. In the temperate region from 35 to 65 degree latitude region there is generally more precipitation on the western sides of the continent and as we move towards the eastern side of the continent the precipitation goes on decreasing.16:30

###### *Precipitation distribution In terms of rainfall volume received*

1. The average precipitation received on the earth is around 100 cms annually. Hence we divide the regions on the basis of precipitation received into 4 types of zones.  
   1. More than 200 cms annual rainfall \- Par Humid or Very Humid region  
      1. Equatorial belt. (from 0 to 5 degree latitude)  
      2. The windward slope regions on the western coast in westerly wind regions. 23:05 24:05 24:56 25:20  
      3. The coastal monsoon regions  
   2. 100 to 200 cms annual rainfall regions \- Humid region  
      1. Interior parts of continents  
      2. Lesser rainy coastal regions  
   3. 100 to 50 cms annual rainfall regions \- Semi-arid regions  
      1. The interior tropical regions   
      2. Eastern temperate regions 34:38  
   4. Less than 50 cms annual rainfall regions \- Arid regions (Desert regions)  
      1. Rainshadow regions in interior continents  
      2. High latitude regions 

# Visibility

Visibility is affected by the dry dust particles or the water droplets or the high humidity in the air. When there are more dust particles in dry conditions in the air (humidity less than 75%) then the dust particles in the air might reduce the visibility to up to 2 kms or less. We call such conditions as Haze conditions.

High humidity regions : When the visibility is up to 1000 meters then it is called MIST. When the visibility is less than 1000 meters up to a few feet is called Fog. Fog is due to smaller droplets. MIST was due to bigger & fewer droplets. 

Haze is due to natural dust / suspended particles. But in some cases these dust which is man caused such as industrial or transport dust particles. When man caused dust particles and Fog mix up they create Smog which is the fourth type of visibility conditions.

# Sunshine

Regions with high sunshine are

1. Tropical regions  
2. Clear sky  
3. Higher altitude regions  
   1. Less effect of atmosphere

Regions with less sunshine are

1. Polar regions  
2. Cloudy regions  
3. Dusty regions

8 Elements of weather and climate are finished.

# Winds \- Contd

### Upper atmospheric winds

##### Rossby waves

1:05:06  
Wider wave types of movements created in the upper atmosphere 1:10;13 are basically the rossby waves. They are much wider and thicker than the jet streams and generally move in a west to east direction in a wave-like manner.

They are in general created mostly due to the contrasting temperature and pressure conditions horizontally in the upper atmosphere between the poles and the equator.

##### Jet streams

Jet streams in general (but not always) are the winds blowing in the center of the rossby waves where the friction is minimum and hence the wind speed is maximum. Therefore the jet streams might have winds blowing at speeds ranging between 150 kms per hr to up to 350 kms per hr. Hence simply said *In general Jet streams are the fastest core winds of the rossby waves.* 1:17:20.

##### Major Jet Streams on the earth

Because at the fronts the temperature and pressure gradients are the highest, hence in general jet streams are created vertically above fronts below the tropopause in general. They generally have a latitudinal width of around 150 to 200 kms north to south. Rossby waves are 500 to 1000 kms. The vertical depth of 2 to 3 kms. 1:25:47

Types of jet streams

1. 1:27:50 Polar Night jet streams   
   1. This is generally created over the polar region during the polar nights 6 months of polar winters. They are generally found at latitudes 60 degrees and higher.  
   2. They help in the creation of polar stratospheric clouds, also ozone hole depletion and Polar vortex phenomena (polar cyclonic type phenomena).   
   3. This is a seasonal jet stream which is in winter.  
2. Polar Frontal streams  
   1. They are generally found between 30 to 70 degree latitude during different seasons of the year as they keep shifting between 30 degrees and 70 degrees latitude.  
   2. They are generally found at the height of 9 to 12 kms. They are related to the polar front formations and have a wind speed around 150 to 300 kms per hour. They play a major role in formation of temperate cyclones in the cool temperature regions. (45 to  65 degrees).  
   3. Round the year  
3. Subtropical westerly jet streams  
   1. Continue from 1:39:51 Geography Class 26\. Watching stopped for Revision at 7/2/2023 7:40 PM  
   2. Westerly implies it is moving from West to east.  
   3. The subtropical westerly jet stream is formed over the subtropical region front and is generally found between 20 to 35 degree latitudes.  
   4. It is found at a height of 10 to 14 kms  and has an average speed of 200 to 300 kms per hour.  
   5. They play a major role in formation of temperate cyclones in the warm temperate region. (35 deg to 45 deg latitude) (part of temperate belt which is closer to tropic is warm temperate and part which is closer to the pole is the cold temperate region).   
   6. Subtropical westerly jet streams also play a role in the monsoon cycle in india. They also are the cause of the winter rainfalls received in the northern and central parts of India generally known as Western Disturbances. It should be noted here that western disturbances do not take place only during winters but they continue up to almost the summer season. (nearly up to may)  
   7. This jet stream flows round the year  
4. Tropical easterly jet streams  
   1. This is a seasonal jet stream which flows only in summers.  
   2. Easterly jet stream flows east to west. It is only in tropical regions. It is a localized jet stream. 1:49:05.  
   3. This jet stream flows only over the Indian subcontinent and the Indian ocean region formed only during the summer season (Indian summer season).   
   4. This is formed between 8 degree N and 30 degree N latitude during June to September season at a height of 14 to 16 kms. They have a depth of 2 to 3 kms.  
   5. Tropical easterly jet stream also plays a major role in the monsoon cycle (summer monsoon) in india. They also play a role in tropical cyclones and depressions and hence in the precipitation during summers in the indian subcontinent region.  
5. Somali Jet stream   
   1. They play a role in indian monsoon by pushing the summer monsoon into india.1:57:38

## Secondary Winds

### Whirlpool or Vortex Formation

2:18:30 2:19:54 2:21:58 2:22:34 2:23:02 2:23:32 2:24:19 2:24:39   
In reality we will have point high pressures and point low pressures. In reality on the ground we might get low pressure centers and high pressure centers. 2:28:52 The diameters of these circles can be huge say 100kms wide.

Geography Class 27

5:48 6:11  
At a low pressure center winds move radially inward because of Pressure Gradient Force. 9:51 In addition to pressure gradient force we also have coriolis force and frictional force which is acting on the surface of the earth.

How would coriolis force and frictional force behave around low pressure circular isobars ? 14:25 15:44 When the pressure gradient force and the coriolis force both are acting then around the low pressure center then from the beginning the pressure gradient force is always radially inward.towards the low pressure center whereas the coriolis force trying to act rightwards in the northern hemisphere and leftward in the southern hemisphere keeps bending the winds till finally the pressure gradient force is radially inwards and the coriolis force is radially outwards and the winds are now rather moving circular round the low pressure center. 20:10 The figure is the effect of pressure gradient force and coriolis force. 22:03 The frictional force will act opposite to coriolis force and hence in low pressure case inwards. 29:45 

32:15

Now finally we find that around the low pressure center the pressure gradient force and the frictional force act radially inward whereas the coriolis force acts radially outwards.   
We had earlier seen that because of pressure gradient force equalizing the coriolis force the wind was moving circular around the low pressure center. Now due to this additional frictional force acting radially inwards towards the low pressure center, every circular motion of the wind tends to end slightly inwards towards the low pressure center as shown in figure 3\. 

39:00 39:45 41:20 44:00

In the northern hemisphere the direction is anticlockwise movement. Hence as we see in the figure 3 around the low pressure center in the northern hemisphere the final wind movement is an inward spiraling anti clockwise wind. Such winds, if very strong, are known as cyclonic winds. They are created around low pressure centers. The anticlockwise direction in the northern hemisphere around the low pressure is because coriolis force acts towards right in the northern hemisphere finally giving the whole wind 50:09 an anti-clockwise direction. 

Around the low pressure centers in the Southern Hemisphere the winds spiral inward around the low pressure center but in clockwise direction.

Final winds around the high pressure center in the northern hemisphere due to pressure gradient force, coriolis force and frictional force. 1:07:01 1:11:32

## Secondary winds \- Contd

### Whirlpools \- Major whirlpool regions on the earth

Different types of cyclonic conditions are created in different regions of the earth for example in polar region, temperate region, tropical region. Here it should be noted that cyclonic conditions generally do not take place in the equatorial region. 1:23:04 The reason for this is for cyclones we need coriolis force and in the equatorial region the coriolis force is weakest. 1:25:06 1:26:22

#### Polar Vortex

During the polar winters 1:29:13 (polar nights) we know that the polar night jet stream is created in the upper atmosphere over the given pole as shown in the diagram. 1:30:36 1:31:36 The polar night jet stream in the upper atmosphere goes on to trap the upper atmospheric winds between itself. 1:34:20. All this is happening just below the tropopause in the upper atmosphere. As the winters progress or continue these upper atmospheric trapped winds go on to become extremely cold being trapped for long periods of time. The extremely cold winds in this region go on to spin or go around the poles in the upper atmosphere. They also form the polar stratospheric clouds which are formed in the uppermost part of these colder winds and major part of which extends above the tropopause into the stratosphere hence they are known as polar stratospheric clouds. The upper parts of the polar stratospheric clouds might become extremely cold causing the creation of the halogen radicals like chlorine radicals which might react with the ozone causing ozone depletion and forming ozone holes. This way ozone hole formation takes place in the stratosphere. 

The trapped cold winds between the polar night jet stream are extremely cold by the end of winters. As the winters start to end the polar night jet stream starts to weaken. Hence their ability to trap the cold air in the upper atmosphere also weakens and hence the extremely cold trapped air is no longer bound to remain either in the upper atmosphere or just over the polar region. Hence these winds start to descend altitude wise as well as move to lower latitudes which mean to the subpolar and cool temperate regions. A Huge amount of such winds blow over these regions as strong winds which are extremely cold causing very freezing conditions in these regions during the end of winters. This is what is known as the polar vortex condition during the later part of winters in these regions. Technically the upper atmosphere rotating winds were the vortex during the winters. But they do not directly affect us then. Only when the upper atmosphere vortex weakens, that we start experiencing the effect of the vortex. But technically in reality when we start feeling the vortex effect in the sub-polar region and cool temperate regions (North america, Canada, Northern parts of USA, northern europe, northern russia) In reality the vortex is weakening but effect on us is increasing. 1:56:38 

### Air Masses

Air masses are formed when a huge parcel of air stays over a region for some substantial time hence picking the broad conditions of the region. Hence large air parcels over colder regions or warmer regions might respectively become colder or warmer. Similarly over wetter or dryer regions they might respectively become humid air masses or dryer air masses. Normally humid air masses are formed over the oceanic regions and dryer air masses are formed over the continental regions. The general dimensions of such air mass might horizontally spread over hundreds or thousands of kilometers and vertically an air mass generally extends up to the tropopause from the surface of the earth.

In general we do not talk of equatorial region air masses. 2:10:04.  
Air masses around 90 degree latitude up to 60 degree latitude. These air masses are called as Arctic or Antarctic air masses.  
The next air mass is around 60 degree latitude up to 30 degree latitude. We call this air mass as the Polar Air Mass.  
The last air mass is around 30 degree latitude up to 10 degree latitude. We call this air masses as Tropical Air Mass.

In terms of temperature Arctic will be the coldest air mass and Tropical air mass will be the warmers air mass. With respect to arctic or antarctic air masses the polar air masses are warmer. But with respect to tropical air masses polar air masses are considered cold air mass.

Arctic or antarctic air mass 2:17:30 2:19:15 2:19:42 2:20:22 2:20:51 

M- Maritime  C- Continental

In the arctic region we always have only continental air mass. Because there is not ocean water there because it is frozen. They are very cold but they do not pick up moisture. They are frozen so it behaves like continental air mass.

What separates one air mass from another is **Fronts**. 

### The fronts

Geography Class 28

2:17   
Air masses are separated from each other by **Fronts**. Hence more is the difference between the air masses, stronger and clearer will be the front separating the two air masses. 

What are the differences or the characteristics of the Air masses ?

In a air mass there is a uniformity of temperature horizontally. 13:20. Vertically it would change with lapse rate. Humidity might be uniform both horizontally and vertically throughout the air mass. 17:30 19:55 20:41 21:30 Lesser the difference between two air masses weaker will be the front between the two.

### Types of Fronts

36:21 40:30

As shown in figure 1, there are two air masses on the two sides of the 60 degree N latitude region and these two air masses do not mix with each other around 60 degree latitude and remain separated by a thin region between the two air masses. This region is over the 60 degree latitude and it acts as a front between the two air masses. This region acts as a strong front because the two air masses on the two sides have substantial difference or variation with each other in terms of temperature. (Arctic \- Colder \- North of 60 deg, Polar \- Warmer \- South of 60 degrees). As the two air masses are not pushing each other hence neither of the air masses are crossing the 60 degree latitude region broadly. Hence this region which acts as a front by separating the two air masses does not have to shift as the air masses themselves are not shifting into each other’s region.47:50 50:55 52:15 

Hence because the front between the two air masses does not move hence such a front is the first type of front we have known as a **Stationary front**. 

55:35 1:02:24 1:06:09 

Thanks to the jet stream in the upper atmosphere high and low pressure regions are created in the atmosphere as shown in figure 2\. 1:09:55 1:15 52   
Hence finally due to the polar front jet stream over the 60 degree latitude localized regional low pressure or high pressure conditions might be created in the upper atmosphere with an opposing pressure condition created over the earth surface. 1:19:25 1:21:50 1:25:35 1:26:22 1:27:00 

As seen in figure 3 the low pressure condition created near the surface will cause the westerlies and polar easterlies to move anti clockwise in the northern hemisphere because of this the front which was stationary earlier will now start to move on the eastern region (region Y in the diagram) 1:29:55 northward being pushed by the westerlies. Simultaneously in the western region (region X in the diagram) the front will start moving southward being pushed by the polar easterlies. 1:32:01. This way because of the mechanical low pressure over this polar front region two new types of fronts are created where the front is being pushed by the warm air in that region we call the moving front as the warm front which is the second type of front. Where the front is pushed by the cold air in that region the front is known as the cold front which is the third type of front. 1:45:00 1:47:00 1:48:43 1:50:45 1:51:23 1:51:57 

As we see in the figure 3.x the cold air mass pushes the warm air mass along the cold front. Here the warm air piles up along the cold front and tends to rise, being the lighter air 1:54:50. This lighter air relative vertical rise along the cold front leads to formation of Relatively Vertical Clouds like cumulo nimbus clouds which lead to heavy rainfalls along the leading edge of the cold front. We also know that along this cold front the wind is moving anti-clock wise (like cyclonic winds in the northern hemisphere) and hence if the winds are strong enough and the rains are also heavy we call such weather conditions in the temperate region as cold front cyclones which takes place over a large region (hundreds to thousands of kilometers wide). Hence this is how cold fronts cyclones build over cold fronts.

2:08:05 2:09:55 2:12:50 2:13:22 2:14:30 2:15:40 2:16:00 

As shown in figure 3.y 2:17:35 when the warm air pushes the cold air causing the formation of warm front, because the warm air is lighter air hence also warm air only rises along the warm front as the cold heavier air remains closer to the ground. In this case warm front is relatively more inclined and less vertical because of which the rising warm air do not form vertical clouds in this case but rather different layers of clouds at different heights leading to relatively lighter precipitation as compared to cold front precipitation. Here also we find that the winds are moving anti clockwise in the northern hemisphere and we get rising warm winds leading to clouds and precipitation. Hence if the precipitation is relatively heavy and the winds are relatively strong we call such situations warm front cyclones as they are formed over the warm fronts. This way the two types of fronts formed in these temperate regions lead to formation of two types of temperate cyclones in the region. 

2:30:30 2:32:26 

Cold front will move faster. (because a heavier thing pushing the lighter thing is faster than the lighter thing pushing the heavier thing) which implies the warm front will move relatively slower. 2:37:02 2:39:23 2:39:53 2:40:33 

Temperate cyclones move eastward. 2:42:36 2:43:45 2:45:11 2:48:35 2:49:10 2:51:31 2:53:15 2:59:15 Hence the front here where we have cold air on both the sides is called as occluded front. It is also called as Dying front. 3:00:35

As seen in the series of figure 4.1 to 4.4 4.1a to 4.4a  we find that the cold front and the warm front finally overlap and finally on the surface only cold air remains on both the sides of the overlapped front. Now because this front doesn’t have very different air on it’s two sides hence the front becomes weak and dying hence we call it as Occuluded front which is the fourth type of front. 3:04:32. This is how the warm and cold fronts come to an end and finally a stationary front is again formed as shown in figure 5.5 3:05:58   
Geography Class 29

7:00 8:35 

### The direction of movement of temperate cyclones 

The temperate cyclones are formed because of the polar frontal jetstream or the subtropical westerly jet streams. Because these jet streams are moving in a west to east direction over the polar front region as well as the subtropical front region which is between polar air mass and tropical air mass. Hence the fronts formed around the moving low pressure regions are also moving in a west to east direction because of which the temperature cyclones also move west to east direction. 16:00 

Some other characteristics of temperate cyclones : 

1. They are formed in the 35 degree to 65 degree latitude region.  
2. They are formed because of the fronts  
3. Temperate cyclones generally cover larger areas. (thousand to two thousand kilometer wide areas)  
4. They form both over land and sea because they only require fronts for their formation and fronts can form over both land and sea.  
5. They generally affect relatively larger areas.  
6. Generally wind velocities in temperate cyclones are relatively lower. It is around 30 kms per hour to 50 kms per hour.  
7. Hence temperate cyclones are not in general destructive cyclones.  
8. They rather have a constructive role in the region where they occur as rains in temperate cyclones are not extreme, they affect the weather conditions of temperate latitude or mid latitude regions.  
9. Temperate cyclones end when occluded fronts are formed as the cold fronts start overlapping with the warm fronts.  
10. The general lifespan of a temperate cyclone is a few days to nearly a week.

#### A special type of temperate cyclone formation known as Bomb cyclone or explosive cyclone or Bombogenesis or Explosive Cyclogenesis

Cyclogenesis : the beginning of a cyclone is called Cyclogenesis. 

A Bomb cyclone is a weather condition where there is a sudden atmospheric pressure decrease which is to the tune of 24 millibars of pressure change or more in 24 hours of time then we call it Explosive cyclogenesis because such conditions will lead to very strong winds. The wind speeds in this situation are 100 to 150 km per hour. Hence bomb cyclones are destructive temperate cyclones.

Generally bomb cyclones are formed over the oceans on the fronts between colder continental air mass and warmer oceanic air mass.  
The common terms for temperate cyclones are Extra tropical cyclones, mid latitude cyclones, family cyclones, wave cyclones.

Frontolysis is the end of a cyclone. It happens when occluded front forms.

#### Difference between Doldrums, Thermal Equator and ITCZ

43:48   
Thermal equator is the line joining the warmest places along the equator around the earth. This way we can draw the thermal equator for the day, week, month and year. The thermal equator is not the same as the geographical equator.

Doldrums 48:45 The doldrum is the region over the earth surface at the equatorial low pressure region where the planetary surface winds are very dull or nearly non-existent. Hence no round the year steady winds are felt in this region and hence such region on earth is known as doldrum.

ITCZ stands for Inter Tropical Convergence Zone. It is between the tropics. It is the zone where the trade winds are converging generally and then rising. Here it should be noted that the trade winds are converging generally between the tropics but not always because at times they converge even beyond tropics. (Specially over the indian subcontinent during the summer period). 59:00 It is generally represented by line but it is a zone. 1:00:45 1:02:15 1:03:58  1:04:10 

In the month of june july august the ITCZ goes beyond tropic of cancer moving to higher latitudes up to the foot hills of himalayas over the indian subcontinent as shown in figure. 1:06:35 Around the month of january (summer of southern hemisphere) between australia and africa the ITCZ remains in the southern hemisphere as expected. 1:07:25 because the warmest temperature places in this region during this period are in the southern hemisphere. But when we see between africa and south america the ITCZ location is not seen over the southern tropical atlantic region but rather even during this period the ITCZ remains in the northern tropical atlantic region as well as northern tropical western african region. Only in south american continent it is seen in the southern hemisphere as the land area is hot here and in pacific also (eastern and central part of pacific) the ITCZ is seen even in january in the northern hemisphere and only in the western pacific near australia the ITCZ comes back to southern hemisphere. 

##### Why the ITCZ does not move to southern hemisphere in some regions ?

1. The tropical southern atlantic is relatively cooler even during the summer season of the region as compared to the tropical western africa of the northern hemisphere.   
2. Similarly in the central and eastern southern pacific, along the peruvian coast generally round the 1:19:55 the water is relatively colder than expected (as discussed in EL-NINO and LA-NINA) and hence this region does not experience ITCZ even during it’s summers.

Simply said southern atlantic, southern eastern pacific and southern central pacific do not get the ITCZ round the year. This is an observation that helps us understand tropical cyclones.

1:22:15

The hottest places in india during summer are not found south of the tropic of cancer. We don’t find in south india we usually find in north india because of the high continentality effect. 1:24:24 

## Tropical cyclones

1. Tropical cyclones are formed in the tropical regions around the tropics but not around the equatorial region. The reason is that there is no coriolis force.   
2. They are formed only over the oceans unlike the temperate cyclones.  
3. They form only in the regions where ITCZ is there.  
4. Tropical cyclones form in summers or late summers when the ocean surface temperatures are the warmest.  
5. It should be noted that the ocean surface takes a few months to warm up and also a few months to start cooling down as water heats up and cools down slowly with respect to land.  
6. Thanks to the above we generally have a low pressure condition over the ocean but an additional low pressure is required for tropical cyclone formation. This condition is fulfilled by the location of ITCZ over the warm ocean region during summers.1:52:29 1:53:33 1:54:25 1:56:10   
7. The importance of tropical region is that the coriolis force is present because of which 1:57:06 the winds will not go radially in to the low pressure region but rather they will tend to spiral around the low pressure region. 1:58:02 in an anticlockwise direction in the northern hemisphere. 1:58:31 (like cyclonic winds).  
8. Hence the conditions are getting more conducive for cyclone development. Thanks to this around the low pressure the winds will tend to vertically rise as they tend to spiral also. 2:01:50  
9. Because of the spiral rising winds cloud formation will start taking place in a vertical cylindrical manner around the low pressure region. 2:03:01 this cloud formation will be hollow in the center of the cylindrical region as the walls of the surrounding cylindrical region will get lot of vertical clouds like the cumulo nimbus clouds. The low pressure center region is now known as the eye of the cyclone 2:04:42 and the vertical cylindrical region is known as the eye wall of the cyclone.  2:05:08.  
10. This is how gradually the temperature cyclone continues to build. For further development of the cyclone the vertical wind speed (at different heights) should not have different speed or direction. We call this as the vertical wind shear should be low so that the eye wall does not break and the cyclone can develop.  
11. Another condition for tropical cyclone development is that in the upper atmosphere there should be a divergent wind condition as shown in the diagram. 2:10:20. If such a condition does not exist, then the vertically rising winds will be blocked at the top hence stopping the formation of the tropical cyclone.

#### Why only over the oceans ?

The inward spiraling winds pick evaporated water from the ocean which is also having heat in it. When this wind rises up with the evaporated water it starts to condense and form vertical clouds because of condensation it releases heat in the upper atmosphere 2:15:45 hence the wind further rises. This causes more air to spiral inward picking more heat and moisture and hence more vertical heating due to cloud formation and condensation in the eye wall. This way the hotter conditions in the eye wall and more moisture and heat supply from the inward spiraling winds mutually support each other accumulating 

1. Huge amounts of cumulo nimbus clouds in the eye wall are super saturated with water.  
2. Lot of heat energy is stored in the eye wall.  
3. Very strong winds spiraling inwards and rising.

When we fully developed this is what we start calling a tropical cyclone. 

2:22:13 2:24:10 2:24:46 

When we are in the eye of the cyclone the sky above is clear. 2:26:15 

If all these conditions are not met the tropical cyclones will not happen.

Some characteristics of tropical cyclones : 

1. Tropical cyclones the winds speeds might range from 60 kmph to up to more than 250 kmph.   
2. The diameter of the whole tropical cyclone might range from 600 to 1200 kms.   
3. The tropical cyclones formed in the trade winds move with the trade winds towards the ITCZ and hence they move in an east to west direction and in a day they might cover 300 to 500 kms of distance.

Geography Class 30  
3:19 4:47 6:31 11:52

4. It picks the heat from the ocean by evaporation and it is stored in the eye wall by condensation.  
5. Tropical cyclones start to end when they reach land. The place where they hit the land is the landfall of that particular tropical cyclone.  
6. Tropical cyclones move in general along with the tropical easterlies in a east to west direction moving generally towards the ITCZ. The wind speeds in tropical cyclones are up to 250 kmph in the tropical cyclone.  
7. The weakening of the tropical cyclone after landfall is known as cyclone dissipation.  
8. But sometimes the tropical cyclone might not move towards the land after landfall but rather recurve 14:12 back towards the ocean due to various reasons causing a lower pressure towards the ocean such as relocation of ITCZ. Such recurving of the tropical cyclone can make it stronger as it moves away from the equator and the coriolis force strengthens making the tropical cyclone more destructive.  
9. On Landfall the tropical cyclones might cause a phenomenon known as Storm surge which causes 17:45 the low atmospheric pressure on the coast to cause the rise of the sea water on the coast and the strong winds causing the risen water to hit the coast turbulently. The water at times might rise by up to 5 meters and hence storm surges can be destructive in general 19:57 and rather they are the most destructive phenomena of tropical cyclones in the coastal areas. 

The common name of tropical cyclones in different regions 

| Indian Ocean | Cyclone or Chakrvaat |
| :---- | :---- |
| Atlantic | Hurricanes |
| Western Pacific and South China sea | Typhoons |
| Western Australia | Willy-willies |

10. If after landfall the tropical cyclones are able to cross over the land 23:19 and reach the oceans again and if these oceans are also fulfilling the conditions for the built up of the tropical cyclones then if the crossing tropical cyclone has not completely dissipated then it might again start to strengthen. This way the tropical cyclone of one ocean might move over to the other ocean after crossing the land.  
    1. For example the tropical cyclones of the south china sea region might be able to 32:30 33:10 34:05 cross the land and reach the bay of bengal. Also cyclones form  
    2. The highest number of tropical cyclones are formed in the northern pacific coast of Asia and hence many tropical cyclones from there might cross over to the bay of bengal. Fewer tropical cyclones cross over from bay of bengal to the arabian sea region. This is one of the reasons why the Arabian sea gets fewer tropical cyclones than the bay of bengal.  
    3. The other reason why the Arabian sea gets fewer tropical cyclones is because in general the bay of bengal water is generally warmer than the arabian sea water. Another reason is the arabian sea gets less fresh water from rivers as compared to the bay of bengal where more fresh water falls from the indian subcontinent. Fresher water helps more in evaporation than the saltier water of the Arabian sea.   
    4. There are fewer tropical cyclones during the monsoon season over the Indian ocean region as compared to before the monsoon and after the monsoon. This is mainly because the vertical wind speed during the monsoon differs as the lower atmosphere winds are southwest monsoon winds whereas the upper atmosphere winds are easterly winds. Hence this difference in vertical wind shear does not allow tropical cyclones to build during monsoon. Hence there are two periods when maximum tropical cyclones are formed around peninsular india. The first maximum is during October, November known as the first maxima of tropical cyclones in india and the second maxima is around may, june period. May june has fewer tropical cyclones than october, november. 47:21. The ocean water is water just before the onset of winters in october, november and hence that’s when we get maximum tropical cyclones in india.

#### Wind speeds and classification of tropical cyclones as per IMD

| Wind speeds | Classification by IMD of Low pressure conditions |
| :---- | :---- |
| \< 31 kmph | Low pressure area |
| \> 31 and \< 49 kmph | Depression |
| \> 50 and \< 62 kmph | Deep Depression |
| \> 63 and \< 88 kmph | Cyclonic storm |
| \> 89 and \< 117 kmph  | Severe Cyclone |
| \> 118 and \< 165 kmph | Very Severe Cyclone |
| \> 166 and \< 220 kmph | Extremely Severe Cyclone |
| \> 220 kmph | Super Cyclone |

#### Naming of cyclones in different parts of the world 

There are 6 regional specialized meteorological centers and 5 regional tropical cyclone warning centers which issue advisories and naming of tropical cyclones in the world. IMD is one of the 6 regional specialized meteorological centers for providing advisories of tropical cyclones and storm surges to the 13 member countries of the Indian ocean region namely 

1. Bangladesh  
2. India  
3. Iran  
4. Maldives  
5. Myanmar  
6. Oman  
7. Pakistan  
8. Qatar  
9. Saudi arabia  
10. Sri Lanka  
11. Thailand  
12. United arab emirates  
13. Yemen

The 13 countries submit 1:04:18 a list of names given by each country from which the IMD prepares a final list 1:04:59 for example in 2020 the second list was prepared by IMD with 13 names coming from each country, a total of 169 names which was prepared in 2020 and presently the names from the list 1 is being used.

The names are given so that an effective warning can be released with respect to every tropical cyclone removing confusion between people. 

The 6th IPCC report (InterGovernmental panel on Climate change.) has specifically taken up issues with respect to tropical cyclones and hurricanes highlighting 6 aspects with respect to tropical cyclones

1. More major tropical cyclones are formed due to climate change.  
2. Wetter and windier tropical cyclones are being formed.  
3. Tropical cyclones are shifting to higher latitude regions because of warming specifically in the north atlantic.  
4. More explosive tropical cyclones mainly because of warmer sea surface temperatures and slower moving tropical cyclones (tropical cyclones across the world are moving slower except for in the Indian ocean region) and slower tropical cyclones cause more damage (slower means the whole tropical cyclone movement).  
5. Climate change is affecting individual tropical cyclones differently making some of them more intense.

As per a study in august 2021 by indian scientist intensity of severe cyclones in the indian ocean region has shown an increase over the last 4 decades which is to a great extent related to climate change.

## Thunderstorm

Thunderstorms 1:23:28 are bad weather conditions which are characterized by dark dense clouds, sudden torrential rains and at times strong winds. But they are over a smaller region and for a shorter period of time.

### Formation of thunderstorms

1:25:25 1:28:28 1:30:35   
Developing stage : 

1. Rising convection

Mature stage:

1. The vertical convection is fully developed leading to fully developed cumulo nimbus clouds which will cause 1:31:40 heavy rains to fall along with lighting and thunder.  
2. These heavy rains might also be accompanied by hail formation. This stage might continue for 10 mins to half an hour.  
3. In the mature stage hence we have two parts  
   1. The rising convection fully developed  
   2. The downward falling heavy rains cause torrential rains for a short duration known as a thunderstorm.  
   3. The downward pouring heavy rains over a period cool down the surface and start weakening the rising convection and ultimately ending it.  
   4. As the raising convection ends, the cumulo nimbus cloud build up will gradually end start the third stage known as the dissipating stage.

Dissipating stage : 

1. In this stage there is just a downward heavy rainfall as the rising convections are over.  
2. 1:37:05 Hence downward draft (air coming down).  
3. Hence gradually no more new cloud buildup as the old clouds rain away and the thunderstorm comes to an end.  
4. This stage might be there for 15 to 20 mins.

For example in central and northern parts of India, the thunderstorms take place sometime around april, may. Thunderstorm happens suddenly and it rains heavily.

## Lightning and thunder

Lightning and thunder 1:40:32 has become important in the Indian subcontinent region as it is the largest most common reason for deaths by forces of nature. National Crime Record Bureau. It has killed around 1600 people between April 2020 to March 2021 after the second annual report.

Lightning is a flow of stream of high current (as high as 30,000 A) which is due to high voltage difference (as high as 300 million volts) in the atmosphere related to clouds.

Types of lightning

1. Inter-Cloud (between two different clouds)  
2. Intra-Cloud (within 1 cloud)

These two types generally don’t affect us on the ground. We are affected by the third type of lighting 

3. Cloud to ground lightning.

1:48:33 1:53:21 1:57:13

When two clouds are moving in close proximity or water droplets and other humid particles are moving vertically up and down within a vertical cloud like a cumulo nimbus cloud electrical charges develop on the upper and lower parts of such clouds 1:58:55 having opposite charges. This leads to gradual high electrical potential difference created between these two upper and lower surfaces, causing high voltages. This finally leads to fusing the air and hence lead to flow high current between these two regions. This very high current literally burns the air 2:01:16 causing lightning as we see. 

This burning of air in the path of the current suddenly expands the air when the current starts and finally contracts the air when the current ends as the charges are neutralized due to the flow. This sudden expansion and contraction creates the cracking noise that we hear as thunder. 

Hence the lightning and the thunder is created in inter-cloud and intra-cloud.

In the cloud to ground lightning the bottom of the cloud acts the upper surface whereas the earth surface (land or the water bodies) act as the lower surface and on these two surfaces opposite charges accumulate, this is because when one type of charge has accumulated at the bottom of the cloud, charges have the tendency to attract opposite type of charge on nearby surfaces in this case the nearby surface is the ground surface or the water body surface. The earth is a store house of charges and hence opposite types of charges accumulate on the earth surface. Here the surface means the highest risen point connected with the earth such as a high tree, high house, tallest building. Gradually when the potential difference between the cloud and the ground becomes very high again the air fuses allowing high current to flow through the atmosphere from the cloud to the ground. This high current flow is what we call lightning falling on ground. In forested or vegetated areas such lightning might fall on trees. In residential areas it might fall on huts in villages and in plain areas / fields / water bodies it might fall on ground surface also. This type of lightning is most dangerous for human beings causing deaths and burns.

Types of weather disturbances : 

7:30 8:00 8:30 10:45 11:35 11:45 12:32 13:20 

These disturbances can vary from small disturbances such as local winds tertiary winds to medium size disturbances such as cyclones which are secondary winds to up to the upper atmospheric waves and other disturbances such as rossby waves which create turbulence in the upper atmosphere. 

#### Tornadoes and Water sprouts

Tornadoes and water sprouts generally occur more in the mid latitude regions and in India particularly we don’t see tornadoes and water sprouts. 23:00 

1. Tornadoes build up on the leading edge on fronts having cumulo nimbus clouds along them.   
2. For very fast rotation or spiraling they require higher coriolis force and very high wind speeds (up to 300 kmph which makes them the highest speed disturbances in the lower atmosphere) they need high pressure gradient which means faster pressure change which generally occur along fronts as on the two sides the atmospheric pressure’s are very different.   
3. They also need vast open spaces and clear grounds of 10’s of kilometers

Hence tornadoes form in the mid latitudes because such fronts are there in mid latitudes. Hence tornadoes are formed on the leading edge of cold fronts.

##### How are tornadoes formed

1. Along these leading edges of cold fronts the pressure gradient is high creating high speed winds which tend to spiral due to high coriolis force due to mid-latitude which are spiraling fast due to coriolis force. As these winds rise along the cold front they tend to form cumulo nimbus clouds.  
2. As they rise higher the winds tend to get faster and gradually a small trunk kind of a formation 34:30 starts to grow downwards due to the high wind speeds.  
3. Gradually the trunk continues to grow downwards. 35:45 from the cumulo nimbus clouds and touches the ground and hence it tries to pick things from the ground and throw them away.36:43   
4. Hence being a high category of weather disturbance causing high destruction on it’s path. 40:00 

In mid-latitude regions tornadoes are most destructive weather disturbances when the tornadoes move over water bodies like rivers, lakes, sea or ocean 41:20 . This sprinkling of water is what we call as Water Sprout. Water sprout is nothing but a tornado on a water body. 

The maximum number of tornadoes takes place in the United states having around 1300 tornadoes every year. The other regions experiencing tornadoes in the world include canada, UK, parts of Europe & Australia, South Africa, Argentina, Uruguay, Southern Brazil, eastern parts of china, japan. 44:35

#### Dust Devil

Dust devils is a weather disturbance which takes place in the dryer parts of the world such as west asia, africa, regions around rajasthan in india, interior peninsular india (dryer parts of maharashtra, karnataka, telangana). Sometimes they tend to spiral. They generally leave a layer of dust spread around. 

#### Cloud Burst

Meteorologists say that when we receive more than 100 millimeters of rain in 1 hour then they classify that rain as a cloud burst. Cloud burst also generally happens from the bottom of vertical or cumulo nimbus clouds. Sometimes the cloud burst also leads to flash floods, especially in valleys or urban areas having improper drainage where the water does not drain out fast enough and the region suddenly gets flooded in a matter of a few minutes to a few hours. But flash floods and cloudbursts are not always related which means not all flash floods are due to cloudbursts. 

##### How exactly cloud bursts form

Cloudburst happens when a huge amount of super saturated clouds accumulate in a narrow region which could be due to upper atmospheric converging wind conditions as which is the general cause in plain areas. In mountainous areas narrowing and closing valleys might cause conditions of cloud accumulation and orographic rise 58:11 might turn the clouds into rain drops. Another required condition is some kind of updraft of winds which can hold the rains suspended, not allowing them to fall down. Over a period as more and more 1:00:02 raindrops are suspended, the accumulated raindrops might suddenly fall, overcoming the rising winds. 1:00:50 causing a Cloudburst like a super thunderstorm. 1908 was the first cloudburst recorded killing around 15000 people in Musi river.

## Monsoon

The term monsoon comes from the Arabic word Mausim which simply means seasons. Hence the weather and climate phenomena of monsoon was given this name because it brought the change in season, So the season changed from hot dryer summers to wet milder summers. Even in olden days it was known that during this change in season the winds in the region also change and during the summer monsoon in the arabian sea and bay of bengal region south westerly type of winds flow. In many historical references it has been mentioned that sea traders (specially arabian traders) used to use these winds changes for navigation and trade. Gradually due to the importance of the monsoon phenomena in our agrarian economy different studies were made to better understand and predict the monsoon and the deeper these studies went over more than a century the better our understanding became but along with a realization that monsoon is a complex phenomenon having a range of factors affecting the monsoon. This is well depicted by the fact that till presently the IMD continues to do a range of studies to better understand the monsoon and hence predict the monsoon. Despite all our advances we are still not more 60% 70% accurate predicting the monsoon especially the short term and regional predictions. Agriculture can be planned well if we can predict the monsoon better.

### Understanding the monsoon phenomena 

To understand the monsoon broadly we would segregate some major factors causing and affecting the monsoon such as 

1. Land & Sea breeze effect on a larger scale  
2. Shifting of the trade winds along with the shifting of the sun.   
3. Role of ITCZ in monsoon.  
4. Role of Jet streams such as   
   1. Subtropical westerly jet streams  
   2. Tropical easterly jet streams  
5. Role of Physical formations in and around indian subcontinent  
   1. Himalayas  
   2. Tibetan plateau  
6. Role of other atmospheric oscillations such as  
   1. EL NINA & LA NINA (ENSO & related Walker circulation)  
7. Effect of minor other factors like   
   1. Somali Jet Stream

#### Land and sea breeze effect

1:43:00 1:43:52 1:44:30 1:45:27

As per this during the summers the indian subcontinent becomes hot and hence low pressure whereas the northern indian ocean remains relatively cooler and hence high pressure and hence during this season, sea breeze type of winds blow from the ocean to the land known as South West Monsoon or Summer Monsoon these winds brings rain to the indian subcontinent because they are moist and coming from the ocean. The opposite of this happens during the winter monsoons (september to december) where the land (indian subcontinent) becomes relatively cooler 1:49:30 whereas the indian ocean part remains relatively warmer as the water heats up slowly and cools down slowly. Hence a low pressure in the Arabian sea, causing the cool  but relatively dryer winds to flow from the land to the sea. 1:51:09 Because of the direction of these winds they are also called the North east monsoon. The winter monsoon generally do not cause rains in most of india.1:52:38 

Hence this way this explanation does broadly justify the monsoon winds. But by this explanation the hotter the land should be in summers the higher should be the pressure gradient and hence stronger should be the monsoon winds. But this is not practically observed year after year as many years we do get high temperatures over the Indian subcontinent but do not correspondingly get a good monsoon and hence there are many years which are hot years but which are bad monsoon years. Hence we understand that the monsoon is not such a simple phenomenon. Therefore efforts were made to explain the monsoon as some kind of trade wind effect as explained below.

##### Shifting of the trade winds along with the shifting of the sun

2:03:12 2:04:20 2:05:45 2:06:30 2:10:30 2:12:57 2:14:08 

As seen in figure A during the northern hemisphere summers (april to september) the sun remains in the northern hemisphere and hence the equatorial low pressure belt also moves and remains in the northern hemisphere, as shown in figure B. This causes the south easterly trade winds to cross the equator as they continue to move northward towards the equatorial low pressure belt. But when they cross the equator the coriolis force direction of bending in the northern hemisphere changes now bending the winds to the right. Hence these south easterly trade winds of the southern hemisphere become the south westerly monsoon winds in the indian subcontinent and the northern indian ocean region. As this is the summer season in the northern hemisphere, hence these winds are also known as summer monsoon winds. So this way the summer monsoon winds are formed.

2:23:00 2:25:50 2:26:31 2:28:11 2:28:50 

As we see in the diagram during the northern hemisphere winter which is southern hemisphere summer the north easterly trade winds try to move towards the equatorial low pressure belt in southern hemisphere, in indian subcontinent and north indian ocean they are known as North easterly monsoon or winter monsoon and in southern hemisphere the same winds after crossing the equator become north westerly monsoon winds or the summer monsoon of australia. Over Australia because they are moving from ocean to land they bring rains during summer (that’s the summer monsoon rain of Australia) but over the Indian subcontinent they are moving from land to sea and hence dry and cold winds during winters.

As per this explanation the sun shifts only up to the tropic of cancer during summer, hence the trade winds should only go up to the tropic of cancer and hence by this logic monsoon should also go up to the tropic of cancer in summer in india. (only up to gujarat, jharkhand, madhya pradesh) and not in the other northern states. But practically monsoons are found up to Jammu & Kashmir and himachal pradesh towards the southern foothills of himalayas. This is explained by the location of ITCZ at the southern foothills of himalayas during the indian summers as we know that the ITCZ shifts up to the himalayas even beyond the tropic of cancer during summers and hence now we will try to understand the role of ITCZ in monsoon.

##### Role of ITCZ in Monsoon

2:40:50 2:42:55 2:44:11 2:45:00 2:45:40 

Geography Class 32

8:00 9:30 10:00 12:05 

Annually India receives around 125 cms rainfall annually whereas the earth’s average 100 cms annual rainfall. That shows India is receiving 25% more rainfall than the world average. Out of total received rainfall 75% of the total rainfall is received is during the summer monsoon or the south western monsoon. 15:31. Almost all the states of India receive rainfall due to monsoon winds.

We know that the ITCZ during the northern hemisphere summers specially over the Indian subcontinent shifts even north of the tropic of cancer up to the southern foothills of himalayas. As per this ITCZ role theory of monsoon, the southwest monsoon winds cross the equator and go up to the ITCZ as the summer monsoon over india. This way it brings rain over the whole of the Indian subcontinent and not only up to the regions south of the tropic of cancer. Another thing of importance to be noted is that the south easterly trade winds crossing the equator between 40 degree east and 60 degree longitude broadly cover most of the Indian subcontinent as the south west monsoon or the summer monsoon and as these winds are traveling almost always over the warm oceanic region hence they pick ample amount of moisture to give the indian subcontinent a decent monsoon rain. During the northern hemisphere winter which is the southern hemisphere summer, the ITCZ shifts within the tropical belt over the northern tropical parts of australia. Hence this time the north easterly trade winds of the northern hemisphere cross over the equator and bending to the left in the southern hemisphere (due to coriolis force) move to the australian region as North west monsoon of southern hemisphere which is also the summer monsoon of australia. But before that the north east trade winds over the indian subcontinent move as the winter monsoon traveling this time from land to sea in the northern hemisphere hence they are generally cold and dry over the indian subcontinent, but when these winds move to the southern hemisphere experiencing summer season they pick ample amount of moisture from the indian ocean and cause rains over the australian region. As this is shown in figure C in the last class.

The challenge despite of this ITCZ role theory of monsoon :   
Many years there is a delay in the monsoons reaching India, especially the northern parts of India even if they have arrived in the southern states. This delay in the arrival of monsoon is not explained by ITCZ alone and this is where the role of upper atmospheric winds in affecting the monsoon comes into play. Hence we will understand the role of upper atmospheric winds like jet streams in explaining the delay in monsoon.

##### Role of Jet Streams

37:50 

###### *First Role of subtropical westerly jet streams \- Delay in monsoon*

42:00 43:58 

The subtropical westerly jet is formed between Hadley cell and ferrel of that hemisphere below the tropopause in the upper atmosphere. Polar frontal jet is formed between the ferrel cell and polar cell of that hemisphere in the upper atmosphere below the tropopause. 45:20 46:24  47:00 The ITCZ will be located between the two hadley cells starting from the lower atmosphere. 49:50. Simply said, we know that during the northern hemisphere summer the subtropical westerly jet will also shift northward (north of himalayas) due to the shifting of pressure cells. But during the northern hemisphere winters as the sun shifts southward, the subtropical westerly jet also shifts southward around the himalayan region. 55:48 Also during the winters in the middle latitudes we know that the tropopause is also lower. Hence the subtropical jet stream is also lower altitudinally (in terms of height from the earth). Hence the high himalayas are able to bifurcate the subtropical westerly jet into two parts 59:13 as shown in figure. The southern part moves south of himalayas and hence over the northern states of india in a west to east direction. This subtropical westerly jet is so located during the winters that south of it will be the northern hadley cell.

As the subtropical westerly jet is also known for creating temperate cyclones like the polar front jet streams which move west to east hence the temperate cyclones created in the mediterranean and caspian sea region, 1:03:50 are carried eastward and some of them come to the northern parts of india 1:04:55 moving west to east and bringing some winter rains. These temperate cyclones are known as Western disturbances in india. Such rains start from the month of december but sometimes they continue up to the month of may as per IMD. This implies that as the western disturbances might continue up to may, the subtropical westerly jet stream also might remain south of himalayas even during the parts of the summer season. This generally happens due to slow heating of the inner continental parts north of himalayas. (they become very cold siberia, mongolia, tibetan plateau in winter). Hence simply said over the indian subcontinent sometimes the subtropical jet and hence northern hadley cell might remain for parts of summer (which is up to May). 

For shifting of the ITCZ up to the foothills of himalayas during summer the northern hadley cell should be north of himalayas, but above we saw that in some years even during summers the northern hadley cell is south of himalayas over the indian subcontinent. Hence the ITCZ is not able to reach up to the foothills of himalayas till the STWJ does not shift fully north of himalayas.

Hence simply said whenever the upper atmospheric STWJ in parts remain south of himalayas, till that time ITCZ cannot reach up to the foothills of himalayas and it keeps lingering in the southern states or south of india delaying the arrival of monsoon in northern part of india.

The challenge now is that all the explanations above do not tell why we get high variations in the strength of monsoon in different years, hence giving us weak monsoon some years and strong monsoon some years. This challenge is explained to a great extent by the role of STWJ, tropical easterly jet, the himalayas as physical barrier and tibetan plateau as a heat region.

##### Role of STWJ, TEJ, Himalayas and Tibetan plateau

1:29:20 1:32:20 1:35:45 1:38:20 1:40:10 1:41:18 1:50:43 1:51:22 1:56:13 1:57:33 2:01:26

During the summer season the tibetan plateau becomes relatively warm hence creating a relative upper atmosphere high pressure and hence a clockwise circulating upper atmosphere wind direction. Simultaneously due to summer season the STWJ shifts completely north of himalayas and hence north of the upper atmosphere tibetan plateau high pressure region as shown in the diagram. The clockwise rotating winds over tibetan plateau help in formation and strengthening of the tropical easterly jet which tends to move in a east to west direction over the indian subcontinent and the northern indian ocean region broadly over the 8 degree N to 30 degree N region during june to september. This tropical easterly jet strengthens the high pressure conditions over the Indian ocean region during summer monsoon and hence has an overall summer monsoon strengthening effect.

Hence simply said, a stronger tropical easterly jet tends to strengthen the indian summer monsoon and weaker tropical easterly jet will give us a weaker summer monsoon and hence the roles of tibetan plateau, himalayas and jet streams in summer monsoon.

Their role during winter monsoon: 

During winter 2:10:16 we have seen that part of the subtropical westerly jet itself is flowing south of himalayas in a west to east direction. Simultaneously tibetan plateau would also tend to have a relative low temperature and hence high surface pressure, hence low upper atmospheric pressure and hence a anticlockwise upper atmosphere wind circulation 2:12:45 because of all this during winters tropical easterly jet is not formed and hence reverse conditions prevail as compared to summer conditions which rather cause a strengthened winter monsoon moving from land (high pressure) to ocean (low pressure). 

Overall configuration of tropical easterly jet we find it (TEJ) to be helping in strengthening summer monsoon. Driving the bay of bengal low pressure conditions towards the peninsular India or towards the Indian region (the way STWJ carried temperate cyclones from west to east) or rather the Indian subcontinent. These low pressures are necessary conditions for causing rains during monsoon known as Burst of monsoon over india. 2:18:21. It also tends to push the tropical cyclones during this period toward India and hence causing rains over India along the path taken by these low pressure conditions.

2:21:12 

##### Role of Somali Jet in monsoons

The somali jet moving from the african coast towards the indian subcontinent during southwest monsoon season tends to carry the southwest monsoon winds towards the indian subcontinent and hence strengthen the indian summer monsoon. 

Role of EL-NINO and LA-NINA will be discussed later. 2:24:22

## Arrival and departure of monsoon

Till 2019 the arrival of monsoon in india is expected to start on 1st June from kerala (around 20th of may in andaman and nicobar) and cover the whole of india by 15 July up to rajasthan. The departure used to start from 1st september and continue till the late december. 

But observing recent changes in the arrival and departure, the IMD has released newer dates and maps for the arrival and departure of the monsoon in india. The newer dates are for 

1. For arrival the date remains 1st June in kerala but whole of india 2:30:22 but it covers whole of india by 8 july itself.   
2. For the departure of monsoon as against the first september date of 2:31:35 earlier, the departure is set to begin more than 2 weeks later.around 17th september and leaves the whole of india (southern states) by December end or late december.

Broadly said the monsoon will arrive over mainland India starting from 1st June in around 5 weeks. Then it stays over the whole of India for around more than 2 months and then before the year end it leaves the whole of india. This leaving or retreating part of the monsoon is what we call the winter monsoon or northeast monsoon.

###### *Rain contribution of monsoon :* 

Almost the whole of India except for south eastern coastal regions receive rains from the summer monsoon also known as the southwest monsoon.  
The winter monsoon or the retreating monsoon generally move from land to sea and generally do not bring rains to most of india. But around the southern peninsular part the winds 2:38:30 move from the bay of bengal (the ocean region) 2:39:10 to the eastern coast of the southern part of peninsula namely the eastern coast of tamilnadu which receives most of its rain from winter monsoons. 2:40:18

Geography Class 33

#### Classification of Indian monsoon in terms of Surplus, deficit etc

This year 2021 the IMD declared in its second long range forecast of the 2021 southwest monsoon that the monsoon seasonal rainfall is likely to be around 101% of the long period average. The long period average of the season rainfall over the country for the period 1960 to 2010 is 88 cms.

| Category | Rainfall Range (% of LPA) |
| :---- | :---- |
| Deficient monsoon | Less than 90% |
| Below Normal | 90 to 96% |
| Normal | 96 to 104 % |
| Above normal | 104 to 110 % |
| Excess Rainfall | More than 110% |

IMD predicts twice, first time in April and second time in June for the monsoon starting from June.

#### How does IMD predicts monsoon of that year 

Based on the March initial conditions of the year, IMD uses 5 models and the outcome of these 5 models is used in multi-model ensemble models and based on that it makes a probabilistic forecast of the monsoon for the year.  
For making this forecast the march initial conditions are taken for 8 predictors18:37 to forecast the monsoon. The 8 predictors used by the IMD to predict the monsoon include 19:37 

1. Europe Land surface air temperature variation  
2. Equatorial pacific warm water volume  
3. Temperature variation between northern parts of pacific and atlantic  
4. The equatorial indian ocean sea surface temperature  
5. East asia sea level pressure  
6. EL-NINO region sea surface temperature  
7. North Atlantic sea level pressure  
8. North central pacific wind variations

All these predictors are used in the dynamical model under the monsoon mission to predict the monsoon using the monsoon mission coupled forecasting system. (MMCFS) under monsoon mission. It is a dynamic model.

## Branches of monsoon

The indian monsoon broadly is divided into two parts 

1. South west monsoon (summer monsoon)  
   1. June to August, september  
   2. Nearly whole of india we get rainfall  
   3. Two Branches  
      1. Arabian Sea branch  
      2. Bay of Bengal branch  
2. North east monsoon (winter monsoon or retreating monsoon)  
   1. Eastern coast of Tamil nadu, we get rainfall (December)

These branches explain regional rainfall during monsoons.  
45:40 46:10 49:00 51:10 52:30 

### Arabian Sea branch

There are three sub branches are arabian sea branch

1. Western Ghat sub-branch  
   1. 57:45 58:15 58:50 1:03:05 Hence the western side of western ghats including the western coastal range receive heavy rainfall during monsoon period ranging from 250 to 400 cms rainfall during the monsoon period making it a far humid region. When these winds move towards the eastern side of western ghats or Leeward side the rainfall gradually decreases making it a rain shadow region. The rainfall is so high in these regions that in recent years IMD has a recorded one of the highest rainfalls in india in the mahabaleshwar region (maharastra) making it one of the wettest regions in india. Even in 2021 around 60 cms of rainfall received in 1 day in mahabaleshwar region.  
2. North of Western ghats & south of aravali hills   
   1. 1:09:20 This sub-branch 1:10:08 moves parallel to the satpuras and the vindhyas both north and south these hills over the valleys of narmada and tapi in a west to east direction causing rainfall in the central india region. These branches go almost up to the Chota Nagpur plateau region in central eastern parts of the country and cause rainfall up to the Chota nagpur plateau region 1:12:42 which gets up to 15 cm rainfall due to this branch.  
3. The third sub-branch moves over the saurashtra and kutch regions and travels west of aravalis.1:15:20 and mostly covering the dryer regions in rajasthan and gujarat. Because they move parallel to the aravallis and also do not get much of orographic effect 1:16:30 hence this branch does not cause any considerable rains in these regions and hence these regions remain relatively dry.

### Bay of bengal branch

The bay of bengal branch first goes up to the Burma hills or pegu yoma or arakan yoma and they are deflected northwards 1:20:31 towards india. Over bangladesh and india region, this bay of bengal region gets further divided into 3 sub-branches.

1. The first sub-branch moving between Jendya hills on their west and Kurvanchal hills going broadly over mizoram, manipur, nagaland, arunachal pradesh and then due to the himalayas on their north these winds are deflected over the brahmaputra valley and they move westward over assam, west bengal and then onwards bihar. 1:24:28 bringing rains to these northeastern states. This branch makes these regions broadly humid with rains decreasing from east to west.  
2. The second sub-branch orographically towards the meghalaya plateau 1:26:35 also they funnel between garo, khasi and jandya hills. All these factors (the funneling and orography) makes this region a far humid region. This region gets heavy rainfall. Mawsynram in Cherrapunji on Khasi hills receives the highest rainfall in the world making it the wettest place on earth receiving 1000 cm of rainfall. (earth average is 125 cms)  
3. The third sub-branch enters over the bangladesh, west bengal & odisha region. It goes west of meghalaya plateau 1:30:40 over the chota nagpur plateau where it meets all the other sub-branches 1:31:30 which collectively move now in a east to west direction. 1:32:12 along the foothills of himalayas over the indo-gangatic plains from west bengal to up to the jammu & kashmir region causing rains over bihar, UP, parts of madya pradesh Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Haryana, rajasthan, punjab, delhi, himachal. This collective branch meets the kutch rajasthan sub-branch of arabian sea branch in punjab and haryana region causing relatively more rain in this region than rajasthan. Also we should understand here that in southern india the monsoon brings more rainfall in the western parts as compared to the eastern parts whereas 1:38:13 in northern parts we have the decreasing rainfall from east to west. This is the broad character of rainfall in india.

## Ocean \- Atmosphere oscillation

The following oscillations are generally between two sides of a big oceanic region like the eastern part and western part of the ocean. In these oscillations we would generally see 1:47:40   
1:51:20 1:52:30 1:53:00 1:53:50 1:55:15

As seen in the diagram in a somewhat alternating manner, wind directions change over the ocean between eastern side to western side, some years blowing east to west and some other years blowing west to east in a somewhat alternating manner. This phenomenon is what we call the ocean atmosphere coupled phenomena also known as ocean atmosphere coupled oscillation. Their effect is that oceanic regions & nearby land regions experiencing low pressure would have rising winds and hence rains in those years. On the other hand the oceanic regions and the nearby land regions experiencing high pressure would experience dryer cooler winds with generally lesser than normal rains in such years and as these high pressure and low pressure regions interchange and oscillate so do the wetter and drier seasons on such coasts.

This kind of oscillation over a cycle of a few years is seen over different oceans 2:03:57 over a period of a few years and is known by different names in different regions. For example in the southern pacific this phenomenon is known as ENSO and Walker circulation or cell. This ENSO includes EL-NINO years and LA-NINA years. EL-NINO years and LA-NINA years together make the oscillation. In the northern pacific this phenomenon is known as Modoki phenomenon. EL-NINO modoki years and LA-NINA modoki years. Modoki is a Japanese word. In the Indian ocean this phenomenon is known as Indian ocean dipole. In the north atlantic ocean we call it North Atlantic oscillation. 

Moving oscillation (west to east) tropical parts of the world between oceans & continents. This is called the Madden Julian Oscillation.

#### The Southern Pacific Oscillation

##### Normal Years

2:18:50 2:19:35 2:20:50

From the south pole towards equator along the western coast of south america peru current flows. Hence this current carries cold ocean water to the tropical regions of the western coast of south america. Hence 2:22:46 2:24:41 2:25:17 simply said in normal years the eastern tropical part of the southern pacific gets relatively cooler water. 2:27:05 2:27:30 2:29:40 2:30:10 2:31:35. The factors causing cooler water on south american coast in normal years

1. Cold Peru Current  
2. Oceanic Coastal upwelling due to land to sea winds  
   1. Rise of deep ocean water to the ocean surface as coastal surface water is carried away by land to sea winds.  
   2. This deep ocean water is colder water.

Hence because of these two factors the tropical south pacific will have colder water. 2:37:35 

Due to continuous westward movement of water from eastern side to western side of the ocean the ocean water levels on the two sides differ, with slight increase in ocean level on the western side due to accumulation of water.  
The trade winds in the tropical region (10 degree Latitude to 30 degree Latitude) do not allow the accumulated water to flow back eastward. But in the doldrum equatorial region the trade winds are weak and hence some warm water tends to flow back in the equatorial doldrum region 2:42:30 from west to east making a continuous west to east flow in these equatorial belts. This is called Counter Equatorial current. 

Geography Class 34

Conditions during Normal years: 

1. In Normal years cold current from antarctic region, peruvian current or humboldt current flows towards the tropical western south american coast causing accumulation of relatively colder water along the tropical western south american coast.

ENSO in South Pacific : In ocean region we get

1. Normal years  
2. EL NINO years  
3. LA NINA years

##### EL-NINO years

This phenomenon happens once every 2 to 5 years. 10:25 11:50 It also starts in december. 16:00. 

During EL NINO years which happens once in two to five years the water from the Australian coast tends to flow back eastward towards the south american coast. This flow is strong enough to flow even against the tropical easterly trade winds. As this water is flowing in the tropical region, hence it gets relatively more warmer causing accumulation of relatively warmer water on the tropical south american coast and hence the water on the australian coast behaves as relatively cooler water. Simply said, this west to east flow in the ocean can be understood broadly as the flow of a stronger counter equatorial current during EL NINO years so as to balance the ocean surface level and water accumulation between eastern and western sides of the tropical south pacific ocean. 

###### *Fishing pattern and the name EL NINO*

1. During Normal years  
   1. The upwelling of cold water and the coming of cold current to the tropical region along the south american tropical coast, causes the rise of oceanic nutrients near the surface of ocean.  
   2. This causes fishes to come in this region in search of food and hence the coastal fishermen of south america get a normal year fish catch in these regions.  
2. During EL NINO years  
   1. During EL NINO years the west to east flow of relatively warm water that causes accumulation of warmer water on tropical south american coast hinders (give some resistance) the upwelling and also does not allow much of cold peruvian current to come in the tropical region. Hence the region does not experience too much steering effect and hence the nutrient availability is also much less near the ocean surface, hence much less fish availability and hence a Poor fishing season for the local fishermen.  
   2. The local fishermen call this phenomenon as the arrival of christ child or boy child and hence the term EL NINO (which in local language mean boy child or christ child)

Simply said the important part of EL NINO year is that the tropical south american coast gets relatively warmer water accumulated whereas the tropical australian coast of the pacific region gets relatively cooler water. This is the opposite condition when compared to normal years. 

##### LA NINA years

52:25  
Every 5 to 8 years the cold Peruvian current becomes relatively stronger than normal years and also the trade wind effect becomes relatively stronger. Hence causing a stronger ocean surface water east to west flow which in turn causes stronger upwelling along the tropical western coast of south america. As a result we get a relatively stronger mixing along this coast, hence better nutrient availability and a better fish catch season for the south american fishermen in this region which they locally call the arrival of girl child or LA NINA. 

Simply said, during LA NINA years the water on the tropical western south american coast is relatively cooler than the water in this region during normal years. But when this water during LA NINA years crosses the whole tropical pacific ocean region, it becomes as warm as during normal years when it reaches the Australian coast. Hence during LA NINA years the temperature difference between the south american coast and the australian coast is relatively more than the normal years. 

These are the phenomena of the ocean.

#### ENSO

ENSO stands for EL NINO Southern Oscillation. 1:03:00 1:04:10 1:06:50   
As shown in the diagram, during normal years south american coast will have high pressure in the lower troposphere and australian coast will have relatively lower pressure in lower troposphere. Reverse of this happens during EL NINO years. Hence between EL NINO years and normal years there is an oscillation of both temperature and pressure on the two coasts. This is what is known as EL NINO southern oscillation. 

Another term related to these phenomena is southern oscillation index : (SOI) 

Index means some number or value given to phenomena so as to compare the different occurrences of the phenomenon. 1:13:45 1:15:34 1:16:10 1:18:20 1:20:20 1:20:45 1:22:10 

### Walker Cell or Circulation

1:32:20 1:33:10 1:34:50 1:36:50   
As seen in the diagram above during normal years the lower troposphere walker cell direction is east to west over the pacific region. Even the trade wind in this region is normal east to west. Hence we can say that the pacific ocean walker cell broadly supports the trade winds and hence the primary atmospheric circulation. 1:39:22 during normal years. 1:42:28 1:43:15 1:44:47 1:45:48 1:46:31 1:47:30 

In the southern indian ocean region we find that the walker cell of the southern indian ocean is formed during the normal years due to low pressure in australia. The ocean surface wind (lower troposphere wind) for the walker cell in the Indian ocean moves from Africa towards australia. This way two walker cells are formed during a normal year, one in the southern pacific and one in southern indian ocean. 1:50:25. The walker cell of the Indian ocean supports the north westerly monsoon which is moving towards Australia during December and next two months. This way a normal year walker cell supports the December monsoon cycle. 1:52:41.

Hence we see that the normal year walker cell strengthens the primary atmospheric circulation in the pacific and in the indian ocean the indian ocean walker cell supports the monsoon cycle of australia, hence preparing the region for indian summer monsoon. Hence simply said walker cells of normal year support the heat transfer process in an efficient manner by supporting the primary winds and monsoons winds both. 

EL-NINO Year Walker cells (December)  
2:04:40 2:05:54 2:06:27

During EL NINO years around December we find that the Australian coast has high pressure whereas the Tahiti coast has low pressure and this low pressure continues up to the south american coast. Hence winds flow from Australia to Tahiti and at Tahiti the winds start to rise due to low pressure, hence a smaller and reversed walker cell is formed between Australia and Tahiti as compared to normal years. 2:08:35. Also the trade winds coming from south america towards Tahiti start to rise partly from south america itself, hence weakening the trade winds during the EL NINO years. Hence no process walker cell is formed between Tahiti and South America and overall the trade winds are weakened over the pacific during EL NINO years.

Condition over southern indian ocean over EL NINO years :   
2:12:39 2:13:50 2:15:52 

Over the indian ocean region during EL NINO years the surface winds of walker cell move from australia towards africa hence creating a reversed indian ocean walker cell with respect to normal year walker cells of this region. Hence the EL NINO year walker cell of indian ocean opposes the north westerly monsoon of australia and hence opposes the december monsoon cycle and hence weakens the overall monsoon cycle. This causes next year’s June summer monsoon cycle of India also to be weakened. This way EL NINO years might adversely affect monsoon cycle and hence Indian monsoons.

Simply said, the EL NINO phenomenon weakens the primary winds as well as the monsoon cycle and hence adversely affects the overall heat transfer on the earth by the atmosphere. Hence regions which are in normal years generally dry like the Peruvian coast which has the Peruvian desert or Atacama desert, receives rains during EL NINO years. On the other hand regions which receive rains normally in normal years become relatively dry in EL NINO years. This is how EL NINO disturbs the normal weather cycle in different parts of the world. 2:29:02 2:30:43 2:32:39 

##### LA NINA Years

During the LA NINA years which is a strong normal year the walker cells of the pacific and indian ocean become stronger than the normal year walker cells in the same direction. Hence making the heat transfer more efficient during the December monsoon and hence strengthening further the monsoon cycle which ultimately gives us a stronger than normal monsoon. 

As per IMD, both monsoon and ENSO phenomenon are related where the warm phase of ENSO (EL NINO year \- Warm water on south american coast) gives us weaker than normal summer monsoon and cold phase of ENDO (LA NINA year \- Cold water on south american coast) will gives us stronger than normal summer monsoon. But it is not a 1:1 relationship which means not every EL NINO nor every LA NINA has an effect on the monsoon. For example as per IMD data  only 40% EL NINO years gave us weaker monsoon and only 35% LA NINA years gave us stronger monsoon. 

As per the economic survey data over the last few years for the period 1981 to 2016 the average agricultural growth rate in India was 3%. We all know agriculture is very affected by monsoon, if we divide the years into three groups as per LA NINA, EL NINO and Normal years then during normal years agricultural growth rate was 3.7% during LA NINA years it was 8.4% and during EL NINO years it was \-2.1%.  Hence the overall effect of the ENSO and related phenomenon on Indian agriculture is negative because if there was never an EL NINO or LA NINA agricultural growth rate would have been 3.7% but when we take the overall effect of all the three sets of years it is 3%. So the overall effect is negative.

#### EL NINO Modoki

The EL NINO modoki phenomenon is a phenomenon of the northern tropical pacific where during the EL NINO modoki year, the western tropical coast of pacific (japan and eastern china) coast is relatively cooler as compared to the central tropical pacific and similarly the eastern coast of pacific (coastal western north america) also have relatively cooler water as compared to central pacific region. Hence because the central pacific is low pressure as compared to eastern and western pacific which are high pressure regions hence winds blow from eastern and western sides of pacific to the central region of pacific. Hence eastern and western sides are relatively dry. 

#### LA NINA Modoki

14:38 15:05  
The conditions in LA NINA modoki are opposite to the EL NINO modoki and hence the central pacific region is relatively cooler and high pressure whereas eastern and western pacific are low pressure because of relatively warm water in that region. Hence winds blow from the central pacific towards the north american coast as well as the asian coast. The modoki phenomena on an average happens between 2 to 8 years affecting the asian coastal region weather conditions.

### Indian Ocean Dipole

It takes place in the tropical indian ocean region. 21:24 23:43 24:32 which is divided into two regions the western region comprising of african coast and india (peninsular india) and the eastern region comprising of the south east asian island countries such as indonesia, malaysia, thailand, singapore. The Indian ocean dipole has two phases, positive and negative. In the positive phase the eastern side remains cool, high pressure and hence dry whereas the western side gets warm water, low pressure and hence wetter conditions (heavy rains). The opposite is the case in the negative Indian ocean dipole case. An average of 4 positive and 4 negative phases take place over a period of 30 years 27:40 with each phase starting during the summers and continuing nearly for 6 months. The positive phase is in general good for rains in india.

So these are the important oscillations we have.

Till now all the oscillations we have seen above were taking place over 1 oceanic region and hence are known as static oscillations. But some oscillations are moving oscillations, out of which one important for us is Madden Julian oscillation. This is a tropical region oscillation oriented east west 30:39 and having two phases or parts to itself. The first being Low pressure convective and hence enhanced rainfall phase whereas the other being the suppressed convective phase which is due to high pressure and hence clear weather and dry. As seen in the diagram 33:00 of madden julian oscillation the two phases are parts of a atmospheric wind cell which moves in a west to east direction and can encircle the whole earth on an average of 30 to 60 days which means we can have more than 1 madden julian oscillation in the same season. 

The importance of this is that any region under the enhanced convective phase would experience wet rainy conditions.  For example, in September 2021, we had a good rain. It just remains in a tropical region and it moves all over the earth. It won’t move longitudinally. 

Hence we are now in a position to understand different types of weather & climate regions in the world.

## Vegetation and Vegetation regions

Vegetation is considered as a major representative of the climate of a region. This is mainly because the vegetation completely depends on the climatic conditions in the region. Hence factors such as temperature, moisture availability which is equal to Precipitation \- Evaporation, Sunshine availability and sunshine intensity. Both of these depend on latitude.   
Temperature effect

1. Polar Vegetation  
2. Temperate vegetation  
3. Equatorial & Tropical vegetation

Moisture effect

1. Par Humid (Very Humid)   
   1. \>200 cms per year rainfall  
2. Humid regions  
   1. 100 to 200 cms per year rainfall  
3. Semi-Arid regions  
   1. 50 to 100 cms per year rainfall  
4. Arid regions (around 25 cms rainfall per year)  
   1. Cold arid regions  
      1. Cold desert  
   2. Hot arid regions  
      1. Hot desert

Vegetation density would be 1 \> 2 \> 3 \> 4  
1:16:40 

Sunshine

1. Photosynthesis  
   1. More sunshine, more time and more intensity the sunshine higher is the chance of photosynthesis.   
   2. Provided moisture is available.

   

The most suitable conditions for vegetation are 

1. High sunshine  
   1. Equatorial and Tropical regions  
2. High Humidity  
   1. Par Humid and humid regions

1:23:12 1:25:32 

Hence now we will take all the 11 regions one by one and try to understand the climate and the vegetation of these regions and also which parts of the world have these climates.

## 1\. Equatorial Climate

The first region is the 0 to 10 Equatorial region. 

### Characteristics

1. Sunshine  
   1. Overhead, relatively intense.  
   2. Availability of sunshine is high round the year.  
2. Atmospheric Pressure  
   1. Equatorial Low pressure belt  
      1. Convective conditions  
      2. Rising air  
      3. Cloudy conditions 1:37:06 : Most of the equatorial land is near coastal regions and at sea level except for the equatorial andy’s region in south america and the equatorial east african plateau region. Hence these regions generally have good moisture availability specially on the coast and in the island regions which gives mostly convective cloud formation generally taking place around afternoon. Hence it generally rains in these regions in the afternoons.  
3. Humidity availability  
   1. Humidity will be high, round the year   
4. Temperature  
   1. Will be high but moderated by rains.  
   2. Temperature is high round the year because the sun never goes far away from the equatorial region.  
5. Winds  
   1. Doldrum region, sea breeze (local winds)   
   2. Easterlies (when pressure belts shift)

   

Hence this region is generally a Par Humid region because it generally gets more than 200 cm of rain annually.

The vegetation should be 

1. **Equatorial (Hot climate) type of vegetation.**   
2. **Equatorial very dense vegetation.**

This kind of vegetation is called the Equatorial Deciduous Vegetation and also called Equatorial rainforests.

Because this region has the optimum sunshine availability along with an optimum moisture availability round the year, these forests are densest forests in the world having nearly 4 layers of vegetation. Because of their high density 2:19:39 generally the ground is not visible in such forests as all the land is covered by dense vegetation. 2:20:13 2:22:18 2:23:11 2:23:55. This kind of equatorial climate is found southeast asian regions, southern parts of nicobar islands, in africa on the congo river basin, 2:25:12 \- 23 , amazon basin and orinoco river 2:16:15 some parts of western coastal south america.

The evergreen forest and evergreen vegetation difference : Evergreen vegetation is the vegetation which does not shed or drop all its leaves every year at a particular time of the year. This character is found generally in vegetation found in low sunshine availability regions such as polar regions and some cool temperate regions. Generally the equatorial and tropical vegetation is not like this.  
Because the equatorial tropical vegetation gets a decent amount of sunshine round the year hence they can easily do more photosynthesis and make more biomass (leaves) and hence the plants of these regions are deciduous vegetation. Deciduous vegetation of plants hence shed or drop their leaves once every year. There are different types of deciduous vegetation 

1. A type of deciduous vegetation : The ones that shed their leaves during dry hot season so as to reduce water loss from their leaves (stomata) by transpiration (process by which leaves release moisture to the atmosphere)  
2. B  type of deciduous vegetation : The ones do not shed the leaves in any particular season as they grow in regions where there is never a humidity shortage. Hence different trees of this type shed their leaves in different parts of the year and not all shed their leaves together in the same season. These deciduous trees make what we call as Evergreen forests where the vegetation is deciduous but the forest never loses all the leaves in the same season and hence such forests remain evergreen round the year though different trees shed their leaves during different parts of the year.  
3. C  type of deciduous vegetation : They shed their leaves during the short winter season where it generally snows for a short period of 2 to 3 months every year. These are called Winter deciduous trees and they generally grow in some temperate regions of the world which get snow for 2 to 3 months.  
   1. They shed their leaves so that snow does not accumulate on their relatively wider leaves which could cause too much overload on the trees and the trees branches might break and fall.

Now the evergreen and deciduous forests : 

1. Evergreen forests :   
   1. Evergreen forests are created by either evergreen vegetation or by B type of deciduous vegetation which will not shed the leaves at the same time.  
2. Deciduous forests : Deciduous forests are forests where almost all the trees shed their leaves during a particular season and hence there are two types of deciduous forests. The winter snow deciduous forests and summer dry deciduous forests.  
   1. Winter snow deciduous forests : C type of deciduous vegetation.  
   2. Summer dry deciduous forests : A type of deciduous vegetation.

2:14:05 

## 2 Tropical East Coast climate region

It is a tropical region from 10 degrees to 30 degrees, East Coast. 

Characteristics

1. Temperature :   
   1. Long and very hot seasons and short cool seasons.  
   2. Maritime effect  
2. Winds  
   1. Easterly winds (Trade winds)   
      1. Round the year  
3. Humidity  
   1. Relatively high humidity   
      1. Generally round the year  
4. Pressure  
   1. High pressure 2:38:21 2:39:39 2:40:20 

When we see the climate of the tropical east coast regions of the world we can broadly divide it into two subtype climates the maritime which is the coastal climate found in latin america or central american regions, african east coast or madagaskar and australian east coast region. Tropical maritime climate is also called Tropical marine climate. The second subtype is the tropical monsoon climate found in the Indian subcontinent and tropical northern Australia as also some parts of 2:44:30 indo-china peninsula. (laos cambodia myanmar vietnam).

The monsoon region has 3 months of high humidity (where 75% of annual rainfall of the region) which we call the summer monsoon. Remaining 9 months are relatively dry (25% of annual).

Whereas in the maritime region overall more rainfall than monsoon regions were higher during hot seasons (9 months) and moderate during cold seasons (3 months).

2:49:21 

When compared with equatorial climate, maritime climate gets less rainfall. Highest Equatorial, Then tropical marine, then tropical monsoon.

Geography Class 36

3:34 5:31

Tropical Marine climatic regions

1. Tropical Evergreen forests  
   1. They grow in relatively more moist region (which means generally coastal regions)  
   2. The tropical evergreen vegetation in such region is similar to the vegetation in equatorial evergreen forest regions with slight less density.  
2. Tropical Mixed deciduous forests  
   1. They grow in relatively less moist regions (slighly interior from coast)  
   2. Mix of dry summer of deciduous  
   3. Round the year deciduous

In tropical region we don’t find evergreen vegetation.

17:18

Tropical Monsoon climatic regions 20:36 we find tropical deciduous forests which are further divided into 

1. Moist deciduous forest 29:22   
2. Dry deciduous forest 29:35 

Tropical marine climate generally restricts on and around the coastal region does have some maritime effect hence though long hot summers but not extremely hot and short cool winters which would not get very cold.

The tropical monsoon climatic regions spread from the coastal regions up to the interior regions also, hence only in the coastal regions it will have a maritime effect but when we get into the interior regions continentality effect comes into play hence the rainfall might decrease substantially in the interior for example the rajasthan region and its neighbouring punjab and haryana regions. Similarly in interior monsoon the summers might become very hot (Uttar pradesh, Bihar, Punjab, Rajasthan) whereas the winters might relatively colder.

### 3 Sudan type of climate or Savanna regions

This region exists from 10 degrees to 30 degrees tropical interior continental region. 40:02 41 ;48

Vegetation is called as Savanna type vegetation.

Temperature : 

1. Long very hot summers  
2. Short relatively cold winters.  
3. Hot summers and cold winters are because of continentality effect.

Winds : 

1. Trade winds  
   1. Relatively less moist. Because they are coming from ocean via region number 2 which already looses most of moist in region 2

Rainfall

1. The precipitation would be relatively less when compared to tropical east regions.

Pressure

1. Sub tropical high pressure belt  
   1. Generally clear skies.

Forests & Vegetation

1. Because the tropical interior continental region is relatively more dryer than the tropical east coast regions, hence in the forests will be dominated by tropical dry grasses which are generally tall and they might also have shrubs and bushes. In such regions trees will be very few, hence wind speeds would be high in these grasslands.   
2. Therefore the trees will tend to become horizontally wide 1:03:40 so as to reduce wind friction. 1:04:36 1:04:43   
3. Such grasslands support lot of herbivores. 1:05:20 (Savannah grassland)  
4. These horizontal 1:06:28 trees are food for giraffe. That’s how the giraffe neck became very tall so as to pick food from these trees.

Regions of this world were we find tis kind of climate :   
1:06:56 1:08:08 

Leaf size in equatorial forests are generally bigger because the forests are dense and hence to collect more sunlight with many other leaves around trees would generally have Big leaves. At the same time bigger leaves may release more water into the atmosphere by transpiration but because in equatorial regions there is shortage of moisture availablily hence the trees can afford to have big broad leaves. When we come to tropical regions we find that though the sunshine is high but gradually the moisture availability is decreasing and hence the forest density also decreases when we move from coastal regions to interior regions and therefore the trees don’t have to grow too tall competing for sunlight therefore the trees would gradually become shorter in relatively more dryer areas and also the leaves would in general be smaller and smaller to reduce loss of water to atmosphere due to sun heat. 56:44 

## 4 Tropical Desert Climate

This region is from 10 to 30 degree tropical west coast. 

Winds : 

1. Trade winds  
   1. Dry winds (relatively more dryer than sudan type region winds)  
   2. Very less moisture

Pressure 

1. Sub Tropical High pressure belt  
   1. Clear sky and dry.

Temperature

1. Long hot summers  
2. Cool short winters.  
3. Temperature maritime effect. 1:15:39 1:17:45 

Cold Ocean Current on Coast

1. Generally on the western coast of continent in the world we have cold ocean currents and hence when the tertiary sea breeze kind of winds blow from the ocean to the land they are not able to bring needed moisture to the coastal region. Hence because of cold current these regions remain relatively dry.

Hence tropical west coast regions are the some of the driest regions of the world.  
Precipitation or Rainfall

1. Very less rainfall   
2. Somewhere around 25 to 50 cm rainfall every year.  
   1. Arid regions

Hence these regions behave like hot deserts.

Vegetation

1. Phyta Plants  
2. Xerophytes   
   1. Dry vegetation  
   2. Grow in almost no water  
3. Hydrophytes  
   1. Very wet region \- vegetation.   
   2. Grow in water  
   3. Salty regions  
      1. Halophtes  
         1. Name comes from salts halogens in periodic table

So in tropical desert regions we find Xerophytic vegetation. The best example of xerophytic vegetarian is 1:28:42 the cactus. 1:28:59 1:29:12 

Characteristics of Xeryphytes

1. Deep rooted  
   1. So as to pick moisture from deep surface  
2. Water storing capacity  
   1. Whole body truck, stem stores water  
3. Waxy surface   
   1. So as to reduce the water losses due to transpiration  
4. Thorns  
   1. Leaves are turned into thorns to reduce water loss

Regions in the world where we have : Examples pick from Atlas

## 5 Mediterranean climate region

30 \- 45 degree Warm temperature western coast.

Pressure belts and winds

1. Shifting pressure belts  
2. Summer  
   1. Poleward shift  
      1. Tropical easterly winds  
3. Winter  
   1. Equator wards shift  
      1. Westerly winds  
4. High pressure belt region  
   1. Clear skies (generally)

Rains

1. Summers \- Less rains  
   1. Because easterly winds are coming from the continents  
2. Winters \- relatively more  
   1. Because westerly winds come from ocean  
   2. They bring some moisture from ocean even if we have cold currents in ocean.  
3. More rain in winter and relatively less rain in summer.  
4. Generally not much rain but it is a temperate region and not tropical region. Therefore some moisture remains in soil because of not much evaporation.   
5. This is not desert kind of regions but it will have some greenery.

Temperature

1. Summers \- Warm to hot  
2. Winters \- Cold 1:53:00 1:54:25 1:55:30 1:55:45 1:56:12 1:56:34 

This climate characteristics is most ideally seen in Northern Chile.

Vegetation in this type of climate is also called Mediterranean vegetation. The mediterranean vegetation is a moisture evolution as compared to xerophytic desert vegetation. Hence it has small but broad leaves and because too much water is not available they usually don’t shed their leaves. So Mediterranean evergreen vegetation is found here. Mediterranean oak, cork etc grow. We also get a citrus variety of trees here which have waxy surfaces and water storing fruits such as oranges, lemon. (they tend to store water). They also have varieties of vegetation like berries, grapes (they also store the moisture). The vegetation here has a waxy coating on the leaves to avoid water loss. In this region we have an evergreen type of vegetation.

It looks like 2:05:30 2:05:40 2:07:07 

## 6 

This region is from 30 to 45 degrees warm temperate region. It is a warm temperate interior continent region.

Pressure 

1. Pressure belts are SubTropical High pressure belts.  
2. It might experience shifting of pressure belts.

1. Summers :   
   1. Easterly winds  
2. Winters :   
   1. Westerly winds

Precipitation

1. Not much precipitation but round the year it will have some moisture.  
2. Rains in summers are slightly more than in winters.

Humidity

1. Some moisture will always be there because of less evaporation

Temperature

1. Temperature has a continentality effect and hence summers are hot and winters are very cold.

Vegetation : 

1. The vegetation here is temperate grasslands with more nutritional grasses than tropical grasslands.

Regions in the world : 

1. 2:24:11   
2. Hence rainfall is less in Eurasian warm temperate regions.  
3. The temperate grasslands in Eurasia, the grasses are shorter. We call that as steppes. Whereas prairie grasslands in north america are taller grass relatively. In china we have one such grassland called Manchurian grasslands. We have one grassland in europe pustaz. In south america pampas and in south africa we call it as Veld (feld) we call these grasslands as High veld grasslands found in upper parts of plateau. 2:29:43 . In south africa the Low veld is tropical grasslands in lower parts of plateau. These are also called bush veld. 

Grass

1. Equatorial / Tropical grass  
   1. Wet tropical grasslands  
      1. Paddy will grow easily  
   2. Dry tropical grasslands (Savannah grasslands)  
      1. Summers  
         1. Millets or Coarse grains  
            1. Such as Jowar, Bajra, ragi, Maize  
      2. Winters  
         1. Wheat is grown in the tropical dry season.  
         2. Oats, Barley, Rye (only grown in winter season)  
2. Temperate Grasses

         1. Wheat, Oats, Barley, Rye  
      2. Winters  
         1. The Temperature here is very low (0 to \-15) so there is no grass.

Most of the grains we eat are the types of grasses. 2:41:05 

Geography Class 37

## 7 

30 to 45 degrees warm temperate eastern coast.

This region also experiences the shifting of the subtropical high pressure belt. Hence during summers this region experiences pole ward shifting of the pressure belt and hence comes under the influence of the tropical easterlies which blow from ocean to land during summers hence bringing moisture and rain. During the winter season the pressure belt shifts equator wards and hence this region comes under the influence of westerlies which blows from land to ocean 16:40 16:55 

As this is the eastern coast climatic region hence on all continents during the summers the easterlies bring in the maritime effect of moisture and rain. But during the winters when the westerlies flow then in different continents the westerlies would have different moisture content depending on how much continental land they have traveled over before reaching the eastern coast regions of the continents. For example when we compare between China, Gulf of mexico and south africa (natal region) 20:56 we find that 

1. China will have the least moisture and South Africa will have the most moisture.

Moisture : 

1. Summer :   
   1. All regions will get good rainfall due to moist tropical easterlies  
2.  Winters :   
   1. Moisture content of westerlies is   
      1. High \- Natal (south africa) (low continentality)  
      2. Moderate \- Gulf of Mexico, South America, Australia, NZ  
      3. Least \- China (high continentality)  
3. The reason for this is that in China we have a high continentality where the westerlies have to travel for long continental regions before reaching the east coastal region.

Hence 3 subtype of climates created in this seventh climate region. They are 

1. China type   
   1. With more continentality effect  
   2. This is also called as Temperate monsoon type of climate because due to the continentality effect the winters are cold and dry whereas due to the easterlies the summers are wet and hot. Hence it slightly behaves like the monsoon.   
2. Gulf type  
   1. With moderate continentality and maritime effect  
   2. The gulf type gets more rain in the summer and less rain in winter. The temperature is also relatively more moderate than the china type climate.   
3. Natal type  
   1. High maritime effect  
   2. The natal type has the maximum maritime effect and hence gets relatively uniform rains round the year with slightly less in winters.  
   3. Even the temperature does not vary too much between summers and winters due to maritime effect.

Vegetation

1. Because this seventh type of region gets good rainfall in summers (almost everywhere) hence it has relatively good vegetation cover as compared to other warm temperate regions (warm temperate western and warm temperate central) hence in the relatively more rainfall region we might get slightly deciduous type of vegetation and in less rainfall region we might get evergreen broadly.  
2. This region everywhere in the world supports a good amount of the human population.  
3. This vegetation is called warm temperate eastern coast type of vegetation.

## 8 British Type of Climate

This region is from 45 to 65 degrees Cool temperate western coast of the continent.  
This region generally has a relatively maritime climate as compared to other cool temperate climatic regions. This is mostly because summers in general are warm (they are not very warm because of the proximity to the ocean and cool temperate region) and winters are also affected by the maritime effect specially the fact that on the western coast of cool temperate continental regions we generally have a warm ocean current. Due to this the winds coming from the ocean do not let the region become very cold. 53:44 

During summer the region come under the influence of westerlies whereas during winters due to shifting of the subpolar low pressure belt it might get some polar easterlies effect also. Hence many polar fronts are created during winters giving this region relatively higher precipitation during winters which during mild winters might be rainfall like october, november and in severe winter december, january snowfall might happen. During summers lesser rainfall would happen only due to moisture brought by the westerlies. Due to maritime effect the region also experiences clear autumn and spring seasons respectively. (all the 4 seasons we experience). 

The regions in the world where we find this kind of climate is 59:20 . This climate is called the British type of climate. 

Weather : 

1. Short summers and long winters. Both of them are moderated. Hence we will not get too much snowfall  
2. Hence it is short snowfall period (2 to 3 months)

Vegetation : 

1. The vegetation in this region is Winter deciduous. (shed leaves during snowfall). If we go to this region in the winter season we will find many trees not having leaves.

## 9 Siberian type of climate

This region is from 45 to 65 degrees cool temperate continental region.

Temperature

1. Short summers because this is a cool temperate continental region where the snow melts and some food crops are grown. Even short summers have temperate cyclonic rainfalls.  
2. Long and extremely cold winters with long duration of snowfall mostly due to temperate cyclonic conditions. 

Winds

1. Summers have westerlies and winters are under extremely cold polar easterlies.

Vegetation 

1. The vegetation in this region is the Coniferous 1:09:05 vegetation which is the cold evergreen vegetation 1:09:56 where the trees have branches and leaves pointing downwards so that snow can slip and fall from them and hence the weight of snow will not accumulate on them. The leaves do not shed for 4 to 5 years. The wood of such coniferous evergreen trees is soft wood & it is light and useful for many purposes such as furniture, construction. 

Deciduous vegetation generally has hard wood and has limited applications for example for heavy furniture or heavy construction work of good quality.

2. The coniferous generally have the same type of tree species in the whole forest, hence very less vegetation biodiversity in those forests. Hence such forests are called Purestand vegetation.  
3. These forests are known as Boreal forests, taiga forests mostly in the northern hemisphere subpolar regions. 1:16:06 

We find this kind of vegetation : 1:16:47 1:17:13 

We will also find this kind of vegetation in mountainous regions such as himalayas.

## 10 Laurentian climate.

This region is from 45 to 65 degrees temperate east coast region.

In the world we find this climate in two major regions. North eastern USA and South eastern Canada and east coast of China, Japan. 

In the coast of such a climate we generally have cold ocean currents on the coast. 1:21:16 

Temperature

1. In summers we have westerlies coming from the interior of the continent. The summers are relatively warm, moderated by continental winds though cold current also moderates the summers.  
2. In winters it gets the polar easterlies traveling over the cold current region over the ocean. Hence during winters the polar easterlies and the cold current makes this region relatively frozen for longer periods of time and more extreme winter than the British type.   
3. Hence this is a relatively cooler climate than the British type of climate. 

Vegetation

1. The vegetation is a mix of the coniferous types in the relatively interior type of regions and the cold deciduous in the coastal regions. 

## 11 Polar or Antarctic or Arctic climate

This region is 65 \- 90 degrees. This region is nearly permanently frozen with the ice covers never fully melting and hence the summers are short and cold whereas the winters are extremely cold and much vegetation does not grow wherever the soil is exposed. But mosses and lichens kind of vegetation grows on the surface. 1:30:39. We find it in the arctic and antarctic regions. Also in northernmost parts of russia and canada where there is too much rainfall.

# Oceans

## Composition of the Oceans

1:42:27 1:42:52 

## Different regions in the Oceans

1:46:17 1:48:47 

Baseline is the average of high tide level and no tide level, this is the line where normal times water hits the coast. The baseline is not the same as the coast; rather it is the line connecting the outermost land points towards the ocean including the islands of the continental shelf (near coast islands, but not far away islands like lakshadweep and andaman nicobar). 1:52:40. We might have some ocean water region towards our internal coastline which is the water between the baseline and the coast known as the internal waters. 1:54:13. The internal water region is as good as land for all the purposes of the country. (legal, economic). 

Measuring nearly 12 nautical miles from the baseline towards the ocean is the territorial waters. 1 nautical mile is 1.852 kms.  This region is called territorial waters. This region is also considered as part of the country and no one can enter this region without the permission from the country. Even the airspace up to the territorial waters is considered the national airspace. Another 12 kms from the territorial waters is the Contiguous zone which is also broadly considered the ocean water of the country but the air space above it is not the national airspace rather it is international airspace and anyone can fly in that region including defense aircrafts. This is also considered the region where the coastal security forces start giving warnings to any unauthorized sea based movements and if such warnings are adhered to they can take action. 

From 200 nautical miles from the baseline all the region is considered as the Exclusive economic zone of the country where though others have the right of peaceful passage, they cannot conduct economic activities such as fishing, mining etc. 

Generally after the exclusive economic zone the high seas of the international sea starts where anyone can freely move, stay or fish. The seafloor mining of the high sea region is done after permission from the international seabed authority. (ISA) which is a body under the United nations. But in some special cases some coastal countries can claim an additional 150 nm region beyond the exclusive economic zone if the region is an extension of the country’s continental shelf geologically. In this case the country has to make a claim from the United Nation Commission on Limits of Continental Shelf  UNCLCS under UN Convention of laws of the seas. UNCLOS where it has to prove with scientific data that the region being claimed is geologically a part of the continental shelf at the coast of the country. If they get this permission then 2:11:42 they get an exclusive right of mineral mining of the ocean floor. 2:12:13 like their right of mining in the exclusive economic zone though they don’t get the exclusive right of fishing here and hence anyone can fish and cross this region. If a country gets a continental shelf right, no country can lay down pipelines and cables. 

## Minerals in the Ocean

## Factors causing movements in the oceans

Different factors such as temperature, salinity which finally affects the density of ocean water which causes the movement of ocean water. 

### Factors affecting temperature

1. Latitude  
   1. As we go to higher latitudes the temperature in the ocean water decreases  
2. The continentality and maritime effect  
   1. In the ocean water continentality and maritime effect where the parts of the ocean which are closer to the continent like the coastal region have their temperature effect due to continentality and such regions of the ocean will be warmer in summer and cooler in winters as compared to the high seas which are away from the coast.  
   2. By the same logic oceanic regions in the southern hemisphere have more maritime effect as lesser continents are there in the southern hemisphere.  
3. Effects of winds  
   1. Winds and air masses also affect the ocean water temperature, especially the surface temperature of the ocean. Here it should be noted that when we talk in terms of ocean temperature and other factors, vertically the ocean can be divided into two kinds of regions with respect to the penetration of the sunlight.  
   2. Generally the sunlight is able to penetrate up to a depth of 400 meters from the ocean surface. 2:30:31. This zone of the ocean is known as the Photic Zone which is affected by the sunlight’s heat as well as surface winds and air masses etc whereas the region which is deeper than 400 meters up to the ocean floor is known as the Aphotic zone or the zone of no sunlight and hence this region of the ocean is not affected much by the sunlight or air masses etc.   
   3. The average temperature of the global photic zone is around 25 degrees (23 to 27\) whereas the aphotic zone temperature is somewhere around 3 to 4 degrees. That’s why during upwelling brings cold water to the ocean surface.   
4. Ocean currents  
   1. The ocean currents which are the surface currents which affect the surface temperature generally. They are further divided into cold currents and warm current which affect the temperature of the ocean surface.  
   2. Also the upwelling of water can affect the surface temperature.  
5. Other factors  
   1. Less mixing and movement of water as in partially enclosed seas such as the mediterranean sea, black sea, red sea, baltnic sea.  
   2. Melting of polar caps can also affect the temperature.

All the above factors are with respect to the photic zone or the top horizontal layer of the ocean but when we talk vertically with respect to the ocean temperature we find 2:40:04 that the ocean region can be divided vertically into the photic zone, thermocline and the deep ocean. 2:40:54. The photic zone temperature in the tropical equatorial regions is normally high and when we start going into the aphotic zone the temperature starts suddenly decreasing from 400 meters up to the depth of 1000 meters. This region is called the thermocline region. (temperature changing fast, cline means changing fast) and the temperature comes to nearly 4 to 5 degrees at the depth of 1000 meters. After that the temperature remains nearly constant up to the bottom of the ocean.

Similarly for the temperate region the photic zone temperature might be around 12 to 13 degrees 2:45:02 and then in the thermocline region the temperature will come to around 5 degrees and then constant in the deep ocean. 

In the polar region the surface temperature itself might be around 4 to 5 degrees 2:46:15 hence there is no thermocline between 400 to 1000 meter depth as there is no sudden change in the temperature and even in the deep ocean the temperature remains constant around 3 to 5 degrees. Hence polar regions do not have the thermocline zone.

Geography Class 38

If the temperature of the water is warmer 3:46 then such water tends to expand and hence the warmer water will be lighter. As the water cools down up to nearly a temperature of 4 degree celsius, the water tends to contract and become denser. Cooler water is denser in general. But as the water starts to freeze, cooling from 4 degrees to up to \-1 or \-2 degrees such water on freezing becomes lighter and hence frozen ice tends to float on non-frozen water. This is how layers of ice float over the ocean water as icebergs. Such floating ice acts as a good insulator and does not allow the water below the ice in the ocean to freeze. 

### Ocean water Salinity

Salinity in the ocean water is mainly due to the presence of salts in the ocean water which are dissolved in the water. The salinity is measured in parts of salt per thousand parts of water. The average salinity in the ocean is around 35 parts per thousand parts of water. 12:46 . In general in the open ocean away from the coastal region the salinity is found to be close to the average ocean salinity. But various factors go on to affect the salinity of the ocean waters such as evaporation due to heat increases the salinity of water because in evaporation only water evaporates and the salt is left behind in the ocean. Hence in general in hot tropical regions the ocean salinity is found to be slightly more than average. On the other hand precipitation as rainfall adds fresh water to the ocean surface and hence the surface salinity decreases below average. Hence for example in equatorial regions where generally rainfall happens the sea surface salinity is slightly lower.

The next factor affecting the salinity is the fresh water addition from the coastal regions, there the ocean salinity is less. For example when rivers add fresh water to the ocean then the ocean water salinity at the mouth of such rivers becomes less. For example in the bay of bengal region the fresh water addition by rivers like ganga, brahmaputra, mahanadi, godavari, krishna, kaveri is high and hence bay of bengal has relatively lower salinity on the other hand lesser major rivers add lesser fresh water and hence the arabian sea has relatively higher salinity as compared to bay of bengal.

Hence this way tropical and temperate regions fresh water addition plays a major role in reducing ocean salinity. In polar regions fresh water is not added as much by rivers, rather the snow, glacier and iceberg melt from the polar coastal regions add fresh water and hence the ocean salinity in such regions close to the coast is less. 

Winds also affect ocean salinity by moving more saline or less saline water from one region to another region and hence affecting the salinity of the other region.

Ocean currents also similarly affect the salinity by carrying more or less saline water from one region to the other region and hence affecting the salinity of the other region. Ocean currents also carry water to partially enclosed regions like Gulfs and bays or partially enclosed oceans and hence affect their salinity.

Partially enclosed regions of the ocean or sea such as mediterranean sea, black sea, red sea, baltic sea do not get proper mixing of their water and hence have a localized salinity of that region decided by whether there is more evaporation in such regions and hence higher salinity such as red sea, mediterranean sea or have more fresh water addition in polar and subpolar regions such as baltic sea, hudson bay where the salinity is less than normal.

The rivers carry dissolved salts to the ocean though the concentration of salt in the river water is very less. Now if the river ends in a lake and the water does not move forward then over a period the salt concentration in such lakes goes on increasing and might become extremely high. Such is the example of the Dead sea in which the Jordan river ends and hence the dead sea has very high salinity of around 250 parts of salt per thousand. The highest salinity found is in lake van in turkey having a salinity of 330 parts of salt per thousand where the water comes from mountains by various trees. It should be noted that if the river does not end in such lakes and streams continue to flow further from the lake then the salinity of such lakes remains very less such as wular lake and dull lake from which the Jhelum river passes.

The salinity discussed in the above paragraphs is basically the surface salinity of the ocean as all freshwater addition takes place on the surface. The vertical salinity of the ocean is as given. 40:36 in the diagram below. 41:32 42:03 46:44 .

The salt addition increases the density of water in general. Hence in general the photic zone water is less dense than the deep ocean water. 49:55 50:43. Pycnocline is the zone of change of density. As we can see in the density diagram in the vertical ocean water density diagram that as a result of the effect of temperature and salinity we find that the resultant density of the ocean photic zone is low whereas the resultant density of deep ocean aphotic zone is high in general. It should also be noted here that due to gravity’s effect the density variation in the ocean plays a role in movement of ocean water (same as pressure gradient plays a role in movement of air). 

58:20 59:47 1:00:01 1:03:01 

When water freezes it generally leaves below the salt and most of the fresh water will freeze. The salt is broadly left to the lower parts. 

The movement of ocean water can take place when for example in polar regions a surface water freezes and the sub-surface water becomes denser and starts to sink to the ocean floor. Simultaneously in the equatorial region due to more rains and fresh water addition less denser water on the surface accumulates and starts moving towards the polar region where denser water was sinking. This creates the surface movements in the oceans. In deep oceans the water flows from polar regions to equatorial regions and finally some upwelling in the equatorial region completes the ocean circulation. This is how large scale ocean circulations take place. 

## Different types of movements in the ocean

### Waves

Waves are the smallest movements on the ocean and they take place only on the ocean surface. They don’t take place in the photic zone also, they are just on the surface. Waves are mostly created by the winds over the ocean surface and two forces play a role here. 

1. Wind force working horizontally on the ocean surface.1:12:18 which cause the water to be pushed and risen.1:13:08  
2. The water rising above is now affected by the second force which is the 1:13:58 which acts vertically downwards to the ocean surface causing the risen water to splash and fall down. 1:14:51 1:15:24 in its surroundings splashing the nearby water which is now driven by the wind force. 1:16:06

This way waves in the ocean are created. 1:17:37 Wave crest is the high and Wave low is the low.

### Tides

Tides are the movement of the ocean water due to the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. The moon has the highest gravitational pull on ocean water because it is close to earth whereas the sun’s gravitational pull on the oceans is lesser. 1:22:51 1:23:13. Due to earth’s rotation the earth tries to balance 1:24:44 the bulge towards the moon by creating a counter bulge on the other side of the earth. 1:25:31. Hence these two bulges in the ocean are called High tides created due to the moon. 1:27:07 1:28:01 1:28:20 1:29:30. 

Similar to the moon’s high tide and low tide as shown in the diagram, the sun also creates high tide and low tide on the earth but the sun’s high and low tides are weaker tides due to the weaker gravitational effect of the sun as compared to the moon. It should be noted here that on the earth we do not experience the sun’s tides and the moon’s tides rather we experience the resultant tide dominated by the moon's gravitational effect. The resultant tide is decided by the relative position of the sun and moon with respect to the earth. These respective different positions of the sun and moon with respect to the earth give us what we call Spring tides and Neap tides. These are two different types of resultant tides and they should not be confused by high tides and low tides as discussed below.

The high tides and low tides are experienced daily based on the dominating effect of the moon. The spring tide and neap tide are experienced as two spring tides and two neap tides in a month separated alternatively by a week. The moon takes around 27 days or approximately a month to do a complete revolution around the earth. Hence 1:44:25 1:48:35

The spring tides happen on the full moon and the new moon day when the sun, moon and the earth are on the same line. On this day the high tides of sun and moon add up giving a higher than normal high tide and on such days the low tides of the sun and moon also add up and hence the water depresses lower than normal. Hence the low spring tide also. 

When the sun earth and the earth moon positions are perpendicular to each other, that is what we call as neap tides and which happens on the two half moon days of the month separated by a fortnight. On this day the high tide of the moon collides or overlaps with the low tide of the sun and the high tide of the sun overlaps the low tide of the moon. Hence because of the domination of the moon in the direction of the moon and opposite to it we do get a high tide but slightly canceled by the low tide of the sun which becomes the Neap high tide which is less higher than the normal day tides. Similarly in the sun’s direction and opposite to it the moon’s low tide dominates over the sun’s high tide giving us a resultant low tide but partly canceled by the sun's high tide. This resultant low tide is known as Neap low tide which is less lower than the normal low tides. 1:58:01 

How frequently in a day we get high tide and low tide : depending on the region where the tides are taking place the frequency of the tide in a day could be divided into 3 groups

1. Diurnal tides  
   1. Where we get 1 high tide and 1 low tide in a day separated by 12 hours.  
   2. 2:00:30  
2. Semidiurnal tides   
   1. Where alternatively we get two high tides and two low tides in a day separated by 6 hours where both high tides are nearly equally high and low tides nearly equally low.  
   2. 2:01:10  
3. Mixed Semidiurnal tides  
   1. Where alternatively we get two high tides and two low tides separated by 6 hours  each but neither the high tides are equally high 2:02:20 nor low tides equally low. 

These three frequencies of daily high tides and low tides are mainly because of the irregular coastal shapes and hence the related complicated overlapping 2:03:35 of high tides and low tides when they are traveling directly or reflected back from the coast.

Importance of tides

1. They create the intertidal region on the coast which, everyday, gets submerged during high tides and exposed during low tides. This kind of region will have very unique biodiversity because it can sustain in air as well as ocean water.  
2. Tides tend to deposit material on the coast as well as erode or take away material from the coast hence modifying the coasts over a long period of time.  
3. Tides are also used for coastal navigation especially at the mouth of the river where tidal ports are created slightly inward along the mouth of the river. Ships move to and from the ocean during high tides to such tidal ports.  
4. Tides are also used for generating tidal energy on the coast as they are a uniform constant source of energy round the year.

### Ocean currents

#### What 

As discussed earlier ocean currents are large volume long distance, unidirectional currents round the year slow movement of ocean water. Though there are some seasonal ocean currents but not relevant for us.

#### Where 

There are two types of ocean currents which are

1. Photic zone ocean currents (surface)   
   1. Up to 400 meters depth  
2. Aphotic zone ocean currents (deep ocean)  
   1. 400 meters to up to ocean floor

#### How are Photic ocean currents created ?

2:21:26 2:23:56 

##### Current 1 : 

1. The cause of the current is the trade winds in the tropical region moving from east to west and carrying the surface water in the tropical region from east to west.

##### Current 2 : 

1. This current is created because when the current \#1 hits the eastern coast of western continent, part of the water turns towards the equator and in the equatorial doldrum region starts to flow eastwards and this water can go nowhere else.   
2. Hence a second current is created moving west to east in the equatorial region known as Counter equatorial current.

##### Current \#3 : 

1. The current \#3 is created when part of the current \#1 After hitting the east coast of the western continent, keep moving parallel to the coast towards the mid latitude region.  
2. This current cannot turn eastward in tropical regions due to trade winds which will not allow the current to go eastward.

##### Current \#4 :

1. 2:37:18 2:38:05 This current \#4 is created when the westerlies in the mid-latitude region over the oceans carry the water from the warm temperate region on the east coast of the western continent to across the ocean to the cool temperate west coast of the eastern continent.

##### Current \#5 : 

1. This current is created due to  the stronger coriolis force effect in the mid-latitude the current \#4 is partly diverted parallel to the west coast of the eastern continent from the temperate region to the tropical region.2:43:02   
2. This is created due to coriolis force.  
3. 2:44:56

##### Current \#6 : 

1. When the remaining part of the current \#4 hits the cool temperate western coast of the eastern continent the water further gets divided partly moving towards current \#5 and hence enhancing the current \#5 whereas the remaining part will move polewards parallel to the eastern coast creating current \#6.  
2. This is how current \#6 is created.

##### Current \#7 : 

1. 2:47:47 2:48:10 In the polar region the polar easterlies blow from poles towards mid latitudes. Here the ocean water from the poles will be driven to and then parallel to the eastern coast of western continent moving towards the midlatitude and hence some part of current \#3 might 2:49:49 mix up with the current \#7 along the temperate eastern coast of western continent.  
2. This is how seven major types of ocean currents are created in all the major world oceans in their eastern and western halves. 

2:50:25

Geography Class 39

Hence when we see in either of the hemispheres of any given ocean, we find that these seven types of currents are created in them. Hence the northern atlantic, southern atlantic, northern pacific, southern pacific and southern indian ocean all have these seven types of currents. In the northern indian ocean we do not get all these 7 types of ocean currents because the northern indian ocean does not extend in the mid latitude and sub polar and polar regions. 5:52 being landlocked by asia. 

For example in the northern pacific we find all the 7 currents namely 

1. North Equatorial Current (Current \#1) \- Warm Current  
2. Equatorial Counter Current 8:33 (Current \#2) \- Warm Current  
3. Kuroshio Current (Current \#3) \- Warm Current  
4. N. Pacific Drift (Current \#4) \- Warm Current  
5. California Current (Current \#5) \- Cold Current  
6. Alaska Current (Current \#6) 11:06 13:19 \- Warm Current  
7. Oyashio Current (Current \#7) \- Cold Current

For example in the southern hemisphere in the south atlantic ocean, \#6 is not formed because south africa doesn’t have cool temperate or polar regions.

1. South Equatorial Current (Current \#1) \- Warm Current 23:14  
2. Equatorial Counter current (Current \#2) \- Warm Current  
3. Brazilian Current (Current \#3) \- Warm Current  
4. West Wind Drift (Current \#4) \- Warm Current  
5. Benguela Current (Current \#5) \- Cold Current  
6. Falkland Current (Current \#7) \- Cold Current

South Indian Ocean \- \#6 & \#7 are not found because south africa doesn’t have cool temperate and polar regions.

1. South Equatorial 27:58 Current (Current \#1) \- Warm  
2. Equatorial counter current (Current \#2) \- Warm  
3. Agulhas Current (Current \#3) \- Warm  
4. West Wind Drift (current \#4) \- Warm  
5. West Australian Current (Current \#5) \- Cold

33:44  
Currents are also grouped as warm currents and cold currents. Warm currents in general move from equatorial to equatorial region, tropical to tropical region, tropical to mid-latitude and mid-latitude to polar region. 15:50

Cold currents move from colder regions to warmer regions such as temperate regions to tropical regions and polar regions to temperate regions. 

In addition to the factors stated above coastal shapes and presence of islands near coasts also affect the currents by many times dividing the current into more than one part. Ocean currents affects the climate on the coast, affect marine life when two currents mix and hence raise nutrients from the sea floor. For example Current \#3 and current \#7 mix on the temperate eastern coast of western continent causing the presence of nutrients for marine life. 37:40 Such regions become good regions for fishing known as fishing banks.

### Thermohaline Circulation

This is the movement in the ocean caused by temperature and salinity which ultimately affects the density of the ocean water. 40:46 42:21 43:18 43:55 44:32 45:09 45:40 46:20 47:12 

#### Formation of thermohaline circulation in the global ocean:

In the north atlantic polar region 49:20 due to cold conditions of the arctic surface freezing of the water takes place (around greenland, north america) releasing 50:17 salt to the lower part of photic zone water. Hence as this lower photic zone water becomes denser, it starts to sink and becomes deep ocean water. This deep ocean water then continues to move first towards the southern polar atlantic 51:59 and then continues to move towards tropical northern indian ocean 52:28 and partly towards northern pacific ocean. In these two regions Upwelling 53:20 of the deep ocean water starts to take place as the surface water becomes lighter due to warming and starts moving towards 54:10 north atlantic as surface flow, in the case of tropical north indian ocean region. Continental barrier of Asia also helps in this upwelling 55:35. In the case of the upwelling in the north pacific ocean 56:13 it is mainly due to continental barrier in the north formed by north america and asia which do not let much of the deep ocean flow to move to the arctic region nor allow cold arctic water to come to the north pacific 58:00 through the narrow bering strait. Hence the north pacific water remains relatively warm also. This way a global warm surface flow and cool deep ocean flow combines together to create the global thermohaline circulation. There are some smaller subparts also created in the thermohaline circulation such as the atlantic meridional oceanic current which is created as a loop in the atlantic ocean. 

This is the slowest but largest scale movement in the global oceans with one complete circulation taking around 1000 years to complete. This circulation plays a major role in maintaining earth’s heat balance by carrying the largest amount of heat from warmer regions to colder regions by any ocean movement. They also carry heat to deeper parts of the ocean due to which such regions also have their deep ocean marine life. This circulation also stabilizes the global climate and climate of different climatic regions. Hence if this circulation is adversely affected, it will also adversely affect the global climate and cause climate change.

The recent climate change causing global warming is expected to increase the temperature by 1.5 to 2.5 degrees. The average temperature of the earth is around 15 degrees celsius. Though the global climatic average temperature would change only by 2 degrees many regions will experience extreme change in temperature and related aspects especially in extreme weather condition regions. Due to extreme change in temperature other related factors such as pressure, humidity, evaporation, precipitation would also be affected on a large scale. Bringing extreme weather conditions changes in many regions. Hence dry regions will become extremely dryer and hot regions will become extremely hotter. Snow covered regions might experience large scale snow melting. Good precipitation regions might experience increased rainfall which might lead to flooding. This way the small looking change in temperature of 2 degrees might have a far fetched effect by creating more extreme weather conditions. 

## Coral Reefs

The corals are one of the initial multicellular complex living organisms that evolved in the oceans. They are invertebrate organisms that are sessile (fixed to a platform and never move) 1:22:23. They are fixed animals. There are two types of corals. They are Hermatypic corals and Ahermatypic corals. The difference between these two types of corals is that the hermatypic build reef deposits and ahermatypic do not build reef deposits. Reef deposits are calcium carbonate hard shell like deposits. 1:26:43 1:27:14 The reef deposit is the home of the hermatypic corals on which they remain stuck for the whole life. 1:29:08 1:29:35 

Characteristics of Hermatypic corals

1. The hermatypic corals have a transparent body.  
2. They do not make their food nor collect their food from the ocean water or surrounding  
3. They deposit calcium compounds around them forming the coral reefs their whole of their life. Huge number of coral polyps stay together each building the reef and hence creating large and widely spread coral reef formations over which these corals live as colonies.  
4. Because they do not make their own food hence they depend on 1:34:13 on zooxanthellae which are a type of microscopic algae which live inside the body of the corals and are seen as colorful objects or pigments inside the transparent body’s of the polyps. 1:35:55   
5. The zooxanthellae are photosynthesizing organisms and hence produce food inside the body of the polyp both for themselves as well as for polyps. This food the polyps use. In return polyps zooxanthellae shelter, the zooxanthellae live inside the polyps.  
6. But the presence of zooxanthellae also put conditions on the hermatypic corals.  
   1. They can only live in the photic zone and not in deep ocean water.  
   2. But because corals cannot float or move, hence they also need a platform in the photic zone, therefore they can only survive on the continental shelf (which is not deeper than 300 meters) or the submerged coastal parts of islands.  
   3. They need clear water, so that they get sunlight. Clear water here doesn’t mean fresh water. They are saline water organisms because they need calcium compounds which are dissolved in the ocean water.  
   4. For example near the mouths of rivers where the water is freshwater, they do not survive.  
   5. They need sunlight round the year to make food round the year and hence can only survive in tropical coastal regions where the sunlight is available round the year.  
   6. Tropical coastal waters are generally warm waters and hermatypic corals only survive in warm water.  
   7. Because tropical western coasts generally have cold currents like the Peruvian coast do not have hermatypic corals. But the exception is the Indian western coast, there is no cold current coming from the arctic. Here we find corals on the Indian western coast. 1:53:02 

### Tropical Coral Distribution : 

The largest region of the tropical coral reef is the Trade barrier reef on the eastern coast of Australia in the tropical zone. Similarly one of the largest densely populated coral reef regions in the world is the coral triangle in the western pacific around the islands of malaysia, indonesia, philippines, Papua New Guinea, Australia. Coral triangle has around 600 species of reef supporting a huge biodiversity of 2000 species of reef fishes and numerous other organisms. This region supports around 120 million people around the coral triangle for their food and livelihood. In india the major coral reef regions are Gulf of Kutch, Andaman & nicobar island regions, Gulf of Mannar region, Malvan coast, Lakshadweep island regions, 1:59:54 .

### Types of reef deposits : 

There are mainly three types of reef deposits that we come across which are fringing, barrier, 2:01:28 and the last one Atoll.

The fringing reef starts growing on the fringes of the island near the coast 2:02:30 in the continental shelf 2:02:50 But gradually the water between the reef and the beach becomes polluted and muddy. Hence not suitable for coral growth. 2:04:46 . Then the corals might gradually start growing away from the coast on the continental shelf 2:05:53 2:08:14. Hence the corals might start growing away from the coast on the continental shelf in the clear water region. Such coral reefs which grow away from the coast are known as Barrier reefs as they act as shallow barriers in the ocean to navigate ships to or from the coast. 2:10:18. Gradually a long period if the existing island tends to erode around which the fringing reef or the barrier reef had grown 2:11:25 then the reef and the corals might continue to grow towards the ocean surface in an attempt to survive around the submerging land and some deposits on such reef by the ocean waves or currents might turn such reefs into islands themselves 2:13:18 which are known as Atoll reef islands 2:13:43. 

### Coral Bleaching : 

This is related to hermatypic corals only. The hermatypic coral reefs are pretty colorful formations because of the zooxanthellae present in them and the zooxanthellae and the polyp has a complementary and symbiotic relation. But when the coral polyps experience stressful environmental conditions which they find hard to survive in, the polyps tend to separate from the zooxanthellae and hence they become colorless and the condition is also called Coral bleaching. Hence bleaching is a sign that the corals are environmentally stressed and if the stress continues for long they might also die completely.

Conditions which cause coral bleaching include : 

1. Ocean water warming  
2. Ocean pollution of different kinds  
3. High coastal sedimentation and release of urban discharge in the ocean including toxic chemicals.  
4. High coral extractions.

### Ahermatypic Corals

Ahermatypic corals collect their food from the oceans and hence do not depend on zooxanthellae for their food. Hence they are generally found in deep ocean floors where the presence of food nutrients is high. They also do not extract calcium deposits and hence hard calcium reef formations and hence known as soft corals also. Hence they are found from the arctic region to the equatorial region in the deep oceans around the antarctic, canadian, new zealand, norway, UK, US, ecuador, japan, australia also in the deep oceans of the coastal regions around india for example the indian ocean region around india we find the black corals or organ type corals and fire corals which are all types of ahermatypic corals also called as Cold water corals or soft corals and across the world more than 4000 species of soft corals or cold water corals have been found but we do not know too much about them because they are found mostly in the deep oceans. The warm water corals or the tropical corals and their coral reefs are also known as the rainforests of the oceans mainly because they have and support the largest biodiversity in the ocean regions. On land the rainforest has the largest biodiversity and supports it hence we use the same term for coral reefs in the tropical oceans. Continue from 2:30:32
