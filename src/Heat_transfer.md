# Heat Transfer
- The heat transfer takes place in the atmosphere (air) or via oceans (water). These are the major things moving on the earth from polar to tropic and from tropic to polar.
- We will focus right now on the horizontal heat transfer in the atmosphere.
- These are the different ways heat transfer happen in atmosphere.
  - Wind
    - Jet streams
    - Cyclones
    - Tornadoes
    - Monsoon
  - Moisture or Humidity
    - In the form of Clouds (Condensation)
    - Rains
    - Fog
  - Pressure conditions
- All of these things together we can call them *Weather* and *Climate*. Heat transfer happens due to all above factors and leads to weather and climate.
- The ultimate cause of weather and climate is *Heat transfer* in the atmosphere.
> Simply said, all the weather and climate phenomena in the atmosphere are ultimately means of heat transfer in the atmosphere.
- When the water vapor turns into water from gas to liquid form it releases heat to the atmosphere by condensation. Hence the atmosphere will get warmer.
- Similarly when water tunrs into Ice on the land or on the ocean surface, it again releases heat to the atmosphere.
## Difference between Weather and Climate

| Difference      | Weather  | Climate           |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------------- |
| Measure   | Temperature, Pressure, Winds, Humidity, Clouds, Precipitation, Visibility and Sunshine       | Temperature, Pressure, Winds, Humidity, Clouds, Precipitation, Visibility and Sunshine             |
| Period   | Short period (minutes to up to 1 to 2 years)   | Long period (atleast average of 30 to 50 years  |
| Effect    | Day to day lifestyle | Long-term Lifestyle       |
| Economic activities |     Crop health or yeild is affected      | Cropping pattern is affected |

Now we need to understand all the 8 elements of weather and climate to understand the Heat transfer in great detail.
