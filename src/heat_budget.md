# Heat Budget
> Heat budget refers to the heating and cooling of the atmosphere.
### The source of the heat
- Almost all the heat that the earth has, comes from the sun.
- Very small amount comes from volcanic eruptions (Negligible).
- Earth's internal heat radiated (Negligible)
## Insolation
- The sun's heat comes to the earth in the form of Infrared radiations. (Visible light, UV radiations). Earth's surface receives only IR, Visible light and some UV radiations. All the radiation coming from the sun to the earth is known as *Insolation*. The full form of insolation is *Incoming, Solar Radiation*.
- Of the total radiation released by the sun, we get 2 parts out of a billion parts, we call it the 2 billionth part of total radiation released by the sun reaches the upper layers of atmosphere. This is also known as 2 *langlays* of radiation. It is 1.94 Cal / Cm2 / min at the top of the atmosphere. This is not on the earth's surface.

The insolation received on the earth's surface (oceans and continents) at different places and latitudes is not the same, as different locations receive different amounts of insolation as discussed below.

## Factors affecting the Insolation on the Earth
- Rotation effect
  - Day side receives the sunlight and the night side does not receive the sunlight.
  - On a tilted axis, different duration of day and night.
    - Different duration of sunlight.
    - Different angle of sunlight at different places (latitudes)
- Revolution effect
  - This revolution changes the tilt with respect to the sun during different months. June northern hemisphere tilted towards the sun, December southern hemisphere tilted towards Sun. Hence different insolation therefore different season.
- Angle of Inclination
  - At lower latitudes insolation has to travel a lesser distance in the atmosphere whereas at higher latitudes insolation has to travel more distance in the atmosphere.
  - Travelling in the atmosphere affects the insolation by absorbing, scattering and diffusing the sunlight due to gasses, water vapor and dust particles. Hence more sunlight reaches the earth's surface at lower latitudes and less sunlight reaches the earth surface at higher latitudes.
- Slope & Aspect
  - On flat plain surfaces the sunlight might fall perpendicular and hence more intense, but on mountanious surfaces because of the slope of the mountain, the sunlight might fall inclined and hence less intense.
  - Similarly, aspect means the mountain side facing the sun will receive more sunlight whereas the mountain side not toward the sun will receive less or no sunlight and hence insolation might very on the same mountain on the two sides.
- Transparency of atmosphere
  - In the region which is cloudy or foggy or misty or more humid, less insolation will reach the surface of the earth whereas in clear sky regions (sunny regions) more sunlight will be there. Similarly in deserts or dry plain regions if it is too dusty then less sunlight will reach the surface of the earth.
Hence because of these factors, insolation on the earth's surface varies from place to place and time to time during the day or during seasons.

### Average Insolation received
- The maximum insolation received is at tropic which is 320 Watts / m2 and at poles it is 70 Watts / m2 and near the equator it is less than 320 Watts / m2 (because equator is generally clody whereas tropic is generally clear sky and poles are in high latitudes)
- At the same latitude continents receive more sunlight than the oceans because oceans are relatively more cloudy than the continents.
- The maximum insolation is received in the *tropical desert* regions.

## Heating of Atmosphere
- How different parts of the atmosphere are heated is discussed below. Now we are mostly talking of the troposphere. The earth's atmosphere gets less heated directly by insolation as greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere are not capable of absorbing the insolation directly. Hence the insolation directly reaches the earth's surface mostly rather heats up the earth's surface.
- When the earth's surface get heated it also releases back, *heat radiation* but this heat radiation of the earth is not so high energy radiation, therefore the greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere are capable of absorbing this radiation of the earth known as *Terrestrial radiation*.
- The greenhouse gasses by absorbing this heat, heats up the atmosphere. Hence practically seen the atmosphere gets most of its heat directly from the earth in the form of terrestrial radiation (low energy radiation) and not in the form of insolation.
- This is another reason why the lower part of troposphere is hotter than the upper part of the troposphere as the lower part of the troposphere is closer to the earth's surface.
- The other ways in which the earth's atmosphere gets heated is *Conduction*, *Convection*, *Advection* and *Condensation*.
- In the hotter regions, the lower part of the air is directly in contact with the hotter surface and hence heated by *Conduction*. This heated air might rise and heat up the upper air by *Convection*. The heated air might move towards the nearby cooler region and heat up the lower air there, this is known as *Advection*.

| Process      | Direction  | Mechanism           |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------------- |
| Conduction   | None       | Contact             |
| Convection   | Vertical   | Rising/sinking air  |
| Advection    | Horizontal | Wind movement       |
| Condensation | —          | Latent heat release |

- Terrestrial radiation might heat up the whole of atmosphere more in the lower parts and less in the upper parts.
