# Heat Budget
> Heat budget refers to the heating and cooling of the atmosphere.
### The source of the heat
- Almost all the heat that the earth has, comes from the sun.
- Very small amount comes from volcanic eruptions (Negligible).
- Earth's internal heat radiated (Negligible)
## Insolation
- The sun's heat comes to the earth in the form of Infrared radiations. (Visible light, UV radiations). Earth's surface receives only IR, Visible light and some UV radiations. All the radiation coming from the sun to the earth is known as *Insolation*. The full form of insolation is *Incoming, Solar Radiation*.
- Of the total radiation released by the sun, we get 2 parts out of a billion parts, we call it the 2 billionth part of total radiation released by the sun reaches the upper layers of atmosphere. This is also known as 2 *langlays* of radiation. It is 1.94 Cal / Cm2 / min at the top of the atmosphere. This is not on the earth's surface.

The insolation received on the earth's surface (oceans and continents) at different places and latitudes is not the same, as different locations receive different amounts of insolation as discussed below.

## Factors affecting the Insolation on the Earth
- Rotation effect
  - Day side receives the sunlight and the night side does not receive the sunlight.
  - On a tilted axis, different duration of day and night.
    - Different duration of sunlight.
    - Different angle of sunlight at different places (latitudes)
