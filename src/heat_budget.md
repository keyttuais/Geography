# Heat Budget
> Heat budget refers to the heating and cooling of the atmosphere.
### The source of the heat
- Almost all the heat that the earth has, comes from the sun.
- Very small amount comes from volcanic eruptions (Negligible).
- Earth's internal heat radiated (Negligible)
## Insolation
- The sun's heat comes to the earth in the form of Infrared radiations. (Visible light, UV radiations). Earth's surface receives only IR, Visible light and some UV radiations. All the radiation coming from the sun to the earth is known as *Insolation*. The full form of insolation is *Incoming, Solar Radiation*.
- Of the total radiation released by the sun, we get 2 parts out of a billion parts, we call it the 2 billionth part of total radiation released by the sun reaches the upper layers of atmosphere. This is also known as 2 *langlays* of radiation. It is 1.94 Cal / Cm2 / min at the top of the atmosphere. This is not on the earth's surface.

The insolation received on the earth's surface (oceans and continents) at different places and latitudes is not the same, as different locations receive different amounts of insolation as discussed below.

## Factors affecting the Insolation on the Earth
- Rotation effect
  - Day side receives the sunlight and the night side does not receive the sunlight.
  - On a tilted axis, different duration of day and night.
    - Different duration of sunlight.
    - Different angle of sunlight at different places (latitudes)
- Revolution effect
  - This revolution changes the tilt with respect to the sun during different months. June northern hemisphere tilted towards the sun, December southern hemisphere tilted towards Sun. Hence different insolation therefore different season.
- Angle of Inclination
  - At lower latitudes insolation has to travel a lesser distance in the atmosphere whereas at higher latitudes insolation has to travel more distance in the atmosphere.
  - Travelling in the atmosphere affects the insolation by absorbing, scattering and diffusing the sunlight due to gasses, water vapor and dust particles. Hence more sunlight reaches the earth's surface at lower latitudes and less sunlight reaches the earth surface at higher latitudes.
- Slope & Aspect
  - On flat plain surfaces the sunlight might fall perpendicular and hence more intense, but on mountanious surfaces because of the slope of the mountain, the sunlight might fall inclined and hence less intense.
  - Similarly, aspect means the mountain side facing the sun will receive more sunlight whereas the mountain side not toward the sun will receive less or no sunlight and hence insolation might very on the same mountain on the two sides.
- Transparency of atmosphere
  - In the region which is cloudy or foggy or misty or more humid, less insolation will reach the surface of the earth whereas in clear sky regions (sunny regions) more sunlight will be there. Similarly in deserts or dry plain regions if it is too dusty then less sunlight will reach the surface of the earth.
Hence because of these factors, insolation on the earth's surface varies from place to place and time to time during the day or during seasons.

### Average Insolation received
- The maximum insolation received is at tropic which is 320 Watts / m2 and at poles it is 70 Watts / m2 and near the equator it is less than 320 Watts / m2 (because equator is generally clody whereas tropic is generally clear sky and poles are in high latitudes)
- At the same latitude continents receive more sunlight than the oceans because oceans are relatively more cloudy than the continents.
- The maximum insolation is received in the *tropical desert* regions.

## Heating of Atmosphere
- How different parts of the atmosphere are heated is discussed below. Now we are mostly talking of the troposphere. The earth's atmosphere gets less heated directly by insolation as greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere are not capable of absorbing the insolation directly. Hence the insolation directly reaches the earth's surface mostly rather heats up the earth's surface.
- When the earth's surface get heated it also releases back, *heat radiation* but this heat radiation of the earth is not so high energy radiation, therefore the greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere are capable of absorbing this radiation of the earth known as *Terrestrial radiation*.
- The greenhouse gasses by absorbing this heat, heats up the atmosphere. Hence practically seen the atmosphere gets most of its heat directly from the earth in the form of terrestrial radiation (low energy radiation) and not in the form of insolation.
- This is another reason why the lower part of troposphere is hotter than the upper part of the troposphere as the lower part of the troposphere is closer to the earth's surface.
- The other ways in which the earth's atmosphere gets heated is *Conduction*, *Convection*, *Advection* and *Condensation*.
- In the hotter regions, the lower part of the air is directly in contact with the hotter surface and hence heated by *Conduction*. This heated air might rise and heat up the upper air by *Convection*. The heated air might move towards the nearby cooler region and heat up the lower air there, this is known as *Advection*.

| Process      | Direction  | Mechanism           |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------------- |
| Conduction   | None       | Contact             |
| Convection   | Vertical   | Rising/sinking air  |
| Advection    | Horizontal | Wind movement       |
| Condensation | —          | Latent heat release |

- Terrestrial radiation might heat up the whole of atmosphere more in the lower parts and less in the upper parts.
- Here we all understand how much insolation we receive and what happens to that insolation ultimately. We know over billions of years of the earth's formation the earth has not been storing the sun's insolation in any substantial way forever. It does store the insolation for some time and releases it back fully. This is why the total hating of the earth does not increase continuously.
- Hence simply said the net long term insolation or heat stored by the earth is *Zero*.
- Simultaneously for the billions of years of earth's formation, the earth has not even been consistently releasing its own heat substantially. Otherwise the earth would have become extremely cold over the billions of years since its formation.
- Hence simply said the net long term heat released is also *Zero*. (this heat is earth's residual heat).
### Vertical Heat Received
- Hence it can be concluded that earth's net vertical heat budget is a *Balanced Budget*. Simply said if the earth received 100 units or 100% of the insolation, then the whole 100 units or 100% received is also released back over the long term. The insolation received and the heat released by the earth are shown in the two diagrams below.

> Scattered means send here and there

- If we get 100 units of insolation,
  - 23 units out of 100 are scattered by the atmosphere (dust and water vapor)
  - Out of these scattered 23 units, 6 units returned back to space directly.
  - The 17 units are absorbed by the earth's surface.
  - Another 36 units reach the earth's surface and out of these 2 units are reflected back by the clouds in the atmosphere.
  - The remaining 14 units are absorbed directly by the atmosphere (from exosphere, thermosphere, some in mesosphere, mostly in stratosphere)
- Hence simply said, we can conclude that of the total insolation received (100 units) in the beginning itself the earth returns back 35 units of the received insolation. It stores or keeps or absorbs only 65 units of the heat. (14 in the atmosphere and 51 on the surface of the earth)
### Vertical Heat Released
- 51 units were with the earth's surface and 14 units were with the atmosphere. Total 65 units are remaining.
- Out of these 51 on the earth's surface, 23 units are released as radiation and of these 6 get absorbed by the atmosphere and the 17 units goes to space directly.
- Out of these 51 another 9 units are released by *Convection* to the atmosphere from the earth's surface.
- Now the left over 19 units are involved in *Evaporation* and *Condensation*.
- So these 19 units are added to the atmosphere by the process of *Condensation*. The remaining 19 units of the heat in the earth's surface is released by evaporation and absorbed in the atmosphere after condensation.
- Hence as we see out of 51 units with the earth's surface, 34 units is absorbed by the atmosphere heating mainly the lower atmosphere (troposphere) because the heat is released from below. Hence it is said that the heat from the earth's surface is the main cause for heating the atmosphere, mainly the lower atmosphere where the life exists.
- The atmosphere also already had 14 units earlier hence simple said the atmosphere heats up with a total of 14 + 34 which is 48 units of heat, which the atmosphere holds for some time to warm itself.
- But as we know no heat is stored for a long time, hence even these 48 units stored for some time are released back to space.
- The total units released to the space is 65 which means the net absorbed is the same as the net released. Hence as we see in the second diagram that finally 65 units of heat is fully released back to space. Hence vertical heat budget is completed.
- In this process, we find that though the atmosphere is not storing any heat permanently, but it does store around 48 units of heat for some time out of every 100 units of heat received.
- Hence when it receives new 100 units of heat, it releases the previous 48 units of the heat back to space which was heating up the atmosphere earlier and stores another 48 units from the newly received hundred units to keep the atmosphere warm.
- This is a continous process and hence the atmosphere remaind warm continously. In the atmosphere, the heat is stored by the greenhouse gasses and agents such as water vapor, dust particles etc.
- Hence if there are more greenhouse gasses and agents in the atmosphere (added naturally or by human beings), the atmosphere will get warmer known as *Global warming* which we are presently experiencing because of increased greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere by human activities.

## Horizontal heat distribution on the earth
- How much of the heat received / distributed in which region of the earth is horizontal heat distribution of the earth.
- 0 to 45 degrees is warmer and 45 to 90 degrees is colder. In the warmer region which is between 0 to 45 degrees, the heat received is more than the heat released. Hence there is a heat surplus in this region keeping the region warmer.
- By same logic, in the colder region heat received will be less than the heat released and hence a net heat deficit in the colder region as shown because of which the colder region remains colder.
- But over the long period, we find that neither the warmer region keeps getting warmer with more heat surplus nor the colder region keeps getting colder by more and more heat deficit.
- This implies that there is a *Continous heat transfer* from the heat surplus region to the heat deficit region on the earth ensuring that the warm region does not get much warmer and colder region does not get much colder.
- Hence horizontal heat transfer on the earth balances the net heat on the earth ensuring the horizontal heat budget is also a balanced budget.
### How does Horizontal heat transfer takes place
- This heat transfer takes place in the Air (atmosphere), Water (oceans mainly). These are the major things moving on the earth from polar to tropic and tropic to polar.
- The major horizontal heat transfer on the earth takes place through the air or through the ocean waters.
