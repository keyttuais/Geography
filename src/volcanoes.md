# Volcanoes

- Volcanism includes all the phenomena associated with movement of molten material from interior of the Earth to the Surface.
- A volcano is an opening in the Earth's crust through which molten materials come out. It is also the place where gases, ashes and molten rock material escape to the ground.
- The mantle contains a weaker zone called the asthenosphere. From the asthenosphere, molten rock material comes out to the surface.
- The material in the upper mantle portion is called magma. Once it starts moving towards the crust or it reaches the surface it is called as lava.
- The material that reaches the ground includes lava flows, pyroclastic debris, volcanic bombs, ash and dush and gases such as nitrogen compounds, sulphur compounds and minor amounts of cholrine, hydrogen and argon.
- Bullet Crater of a volcano is a cylindrical opening through which magma or lava comes out to the surface of the Earth.
- The main causes of volcanic eruption are plate-tectonics. Weak layer of crust, high temperature of core and evolution of gases near sea floor.

> Rocks formed by either plutonic or volcanic activity are called Igneous Rocks.

### Parts of Volcano
- Magma Champter : It is a large underground pool of molten rock under pressure sitting underneath the Earth's crust. Generally, magma chambers are located close to Earth's surface, usually between 1km to 10km deep.
- Volcanic vent : It is the weak point in the Earth's crust where hot magma has been able to rise from the magma chamber and reach the surface.
- Volcanic cone : It is made layers of igneous rocks formed from previous eruptions. Each lava flow add a new layer to the volcanic cone.
- Volcanic crater : It is depression or hollow from which eruptions expel magmatic material (Lava, gas, steam ash etc)

### Types of Volcano on the basis of Eruption
- Hawaiian Type : In this type of volcano, extremely fluid lava comes out on the surface of the Earth. It is mostly basaltic and spreads over large areas.
- Strombolian Type : Strombolian type is the most typical volcano which are less explosive. There are several small explosive activities where lava is more viscous. It has the power to explode the crust. E.g, Stromboli Volcano, Lipari Island (North Sicily), Mauna Loa Volcano (Hawaiian Island)
- Volcanian Type : In this type, lava is very viscous and the eruptions take place at a longer intervals. Large quantities of pryclastic materials are erupted from them. E.g. Volcanoes in Lipari island group of Mediterranean Sea.
- Vesuvian Type or Plinian Type : In this type long intervals take place between two eruptions. These are extremely violent and their lava is highly viscous. E.g, Volcano that existed near Naples in Italy.
- Pelean Type : In this type, lava is viscous and highly destructive and fast-moving mass gets erupted. E.g., Mounte Pelee on Martinque island in the West Indies.
- Fissure eruption or Quiet Eruption : Large quantity of lava quietly flows up from fissures and spreads out over the surrounding areas. Successive flow of lava results in the growth of lava plateau. E.g., Deccan Plateau.

### Types of Volcanoes on the Basis of Activity
- Active Volcano : A volcano is called an active volcano if the materials mentioned are being released or have released in the recent past. These volcanoes constantly eject volcanic lava, gas and ashes. E.g., Cotopaxi, Mt. Erebus, Mt. Etna, Strombolian etc. Due to its recent activity and nearbly population *Mount Etna* has been designated a *Decade Volcano* by the United Nations
- Dormant Volcano : These are volcanoes, which were active in past, but for several years have not shown any activity, They can erupt very violently and cause huge damage. E.g., Mt. Krakatoa, Vesuvius (italy), Fujiyama (Japan) etc.
- Extinct Volcano : A Volcano which erupted in the distant geological past and there is no longer any active volcanicity. They show no indications of future eruptions. E.g., Popa (Myanmar), Mt Demvand and Koh-Sultan (Iran).

### Types of Volcano on the Basis of Nature of Eruption
- **Shield Volcanoes** : Barring the basalt flows, the shield volanoes are the largest of all the volcanoes on the Earth. The Hawaiian volcanoes are the most famous examples. Since the volanoes are mostly made up of very fluid basalt, this is the reason, these volcanoes are not steep. They are characterised by low-explosivity. When water gets into the vent, they become explosive. The upcoming lava moves in the form of a fountain and throws out the cone at the top of the vent and develops into a cinder cone.
- **Composite Volcanoes** : These are the most explosive of Earth's volcanoes. When they erupt, they tent to collapse on themselves rather than building any tall structure. The collapsed depressions are called Calderas. Their magma chamber supplying the lava is not only huge but also in close vicinity.
- **Flood Basalt Provinces** These volcanoes outpour highly fluid lava that flows for long distances. There can be a series of flows with some flows attaining thickness of more than 50 m. The Deccan traps from India, are a much larger floor basalt province. It is believed that initially the traop formations covered a much larger area than the present.
- **Mid-Ocean Ridge Volcanoes** These volcanoes occur in the oceanic areas. There is a system of mid-ocean ridges more than 70,000 km long that stretches through all the ocean basins. The central portion of this ridge experiences frequent eruptions.

### Topographic Features of Volcanoes
- Magma is of two types i.e., **basaltic** and **granati**. Basaltic magma is fluid while granitic magma is visous.

>Viscosity is a measure of a fluid’s resistance to deformation or flow. Higher viscosity = thicker fluid. Water has low viscosity and Oil has high viscosity.

- Once magma comes to the surface of the Earth, it is lighter than the adjoining rocks, moves upward towards the surface and gives rise to certain topographic features.
- The cooling of Magma may take place either on reaching the surface or also while the lava is still in the crustal portion.
- Depending on the location of the cooling of the lava, igneous rocks are classified as volcanic rocks and plutonic rocks.
- When rocks are formed by cooling at the surface it is known as volcanic rocks. When by cooling in the crust it is known as plutonic rocks.

#### Intrusive Features
- When the volcanic features are formed beneath the surface, they are called as intrusive features. Some of the important intrusive featuers are as follows:
> Igneous intrusions on a larger scale are the varies types of Liths
  - **Batholiths** These are the cooled portion of magma chambers. A large body of magmatic material that cools in the deeper depth of the crust develops in the form of large domes. These are granitic bodies.
  - **Laccoliths** These are large *dome-shaped* intrusive bodies with a level base and connected by a pipe-like conduit from below. It resembles the surface volcanic domes of composite volcano, only these are located at deeper depths. e.g., laccoliths of the Henry Mountains, in Utah U.S.A.
  - **Lapolith** As and when the lava moves upwards, a portion of the same may tend to move in a horizontal direction wherever it finds a weak plane. It may get rested in different forms. In case it develops into a saucer shape, concave to the sky body, it is called Lapolith. It is an intrusion with a *Saucer Shape*. The Bushveld lapoliths of Transvaal, South Africa are good examples.
  - **Phacoliths** A wavy mass of intrusive rocks, at times, is found at the base of synclines or at the top of anticline in folded igneous country. Such wavy materials have a definite conduit to source beneath in the form of magma chambers. These are called phacoliths. An example of phacolith is Corndon Hill in Shropshire, England.
  - **Sills** The near horizontal bodies of the intrusive igneous rocks are called sill or sheet, depending on the thickness of the material. The thinner ones are called sheets while the thick horizontal deposits are called Sills. When a intrusion of molten magma is made *Horizontally* along the bedding planes of sedimentary rocks, the resultant intrusion is called Sill. Denudation of the overlying sedimentary strata will expose the intrusion which will resemble a lava flor or form a bold escarpment like the Great Whin Sill of N.E. England.

  - **Dykes** When the lava makes its way through cracks and the fissures developed in the land, it solidifies almost perpendicular to the ground. It gets cooled in the same poisition to develop a wall like structure. Such structures are called Dykes. Examples of Dykes are the Cleveland Dyke of Yorkshire, England and hundreds of others in the Isles of Muli and Arran in Scotland. A large, very resistant dyke of quartzite forms a long ridge to the north of Kaula Lampur.

> Denudation is process of wearing away the Earth's surface by natural agents like: Weathering, Erosion, Transportation and deposition.

#### Extrusive Features
- **Flood Basalts** These are formed by fissure eruption. Due to less viscous basaltic lava it erupts with no explosive activity. e.g., Deccan trap.
- **Shield Volcanoes** These are huge domes of basalt. It is formed as a result of continued outpouring of great quantities of highly fluied basaltic lava. e.g., Mt Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa in Hawaii.
- **Ash or Cinder Cone** These are usually of low height and are formed of volcanic dust, ashes and pyroclastic matter. They are formed when the eruption is of central type with a predominance of pyroclastic materials. e.g., Paricutin, Mexico.
- **Composite or Strata Cone** It is the highest of all volcanic cones. These are formed due to accumulation of different layers of various volcanic materials and hence, called as *strato-cones*. These are built up by alternate layers of lava and fragmental flows. e.g., Pinatubo of Philippines, Fuji in Japan.
- **Parasitic Cone** Several branches of pipes come out from the main centre pipe of the volcano. Lava and other volcanic material will come out from these minor pipes and get deposited around these newly formed vents. The smaller cones formed on major cones are termed as a parasitic cone.
- **Crater** The depression formed at the mouth of a volcanic vent is known as crater or Volcanic mouth. It is usually funnel shaped.
- **Caldera** It is enlarged form of a crater. These are either formed by the subsidence of a crater or by violent and explosive eruption of volcanoes.
- **Hot Springs** These are formed when groundwater comes in contact with the magma. When ground water gets heated beyong 36 degrees, it comes to the surface as a hot spring. e.g., Ladakh, Manali, Volcanic regions of Iceland, Yellow stone National park.
- **Geyser** It is a special type of hot spring. It ejects steam and superheated water at regular intervals. e.g., Old faithful geyser in the USA, which erupts faithfully after every 66 minutes.
- **Fumaroles** They are characterised by full scale continous jet-like emission of hot water from a vent. These are the vent through which gases and water vapour are emitted.

### Distribution of Volcanic Belts
- Distribution of volcanic belts is uneven in the world. There are following three prominent volcanic belts.
- **Circum-Pacific Belt**
  - Circum-Pacific region popularly termed as the *Pacific Ring of Fire*
  - It has the greatest concentration of active volcanoes. Volcanic belt and earthquake belt closely overlap along the Pacific ring of fire.
  - It extends across the Kamchatka Peninsula, Kuril Islands, the Islands of Japan, Philippines, New Guinea, New Zealand and the solomon islands.
  - It also passed through antarctica and the western coast of north and south america.
- **Mid-Continental Belt**
  - This belt is formed as a result of convergence between the Eurasian plate and the Northward moving African plate.
  - It includes volcanoes of the Alpine mountain chain, the Mediterrainean sea and the fault zone of Eastern Africa of Stromboli, Vesuvius, Etna, Kilimanjaro etc.
- **Mid-Atlantic Belt**
  - These are located on divergent plate boundaries. The mid-atlantic ridge is a volcanic mountain rage that rises from the atlantic abyssal plain, extending from the Arctic to the Antarctic.
  - In this belt, the volcanoes are fissure eruption type. e.g., Iceland, Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Azores etc.
