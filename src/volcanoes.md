# Volcanoes

- Volcanism includes all the phenomena associated with movement of molten material from interior of the Earth to the Surface.
- A volcano is an opening in the Earth's crust through which molten materials come out. It is also the place where gases, ashes and molten rock material escape to the ground.
- The mantle contains a weaker zone called the asthenosphere. From the asthenosphere, molten rock material comes out to the surface.
- The material in the upper mantle portion is called magma. Once it starts moving towards the crust or it reaches the surface it is called as lava.
- The material that reaches the ground includes lava flows, pyroclastic debris, volcanic bombs, ash and dush and gases such as nitrogen compounds, sulphur compounds and minor amounts of cholrine, hydrogen and argon.
- Bullet Crater of a volcano is a cylindrical opening through which magma or lava comes out to the surface of the Earth.
- The main causes of volcanic eruption are plate-tectonics. Weak layer of crust, high temperature of core and evolution of gases near sea floor.

### Parts of Volcano
- Magma Champter : It is a large underground pool of molten rock under pressure sitting underneath the Earth's crust. Generally, magma chambers are located close to Earth's surface, usually between 1km to 10km deep.
- Volcanic vent : It is the weak point in the Earth's crust where hot magma has been able to rise from the magma chamber and reach the surface.
- Volcanic cone : It is made layers of igneous rocks formed from previous eruptions. Each lava flow add a new layer to the volcanic cone.
- Volcanic crater : It is depression or hollow from which eruptions expel magmatic material (Lava, gas, steam ash etc)

### Types of Volcano on the basis of Eruption
- Hawaiian Type : In this type of volcano, extremely fluid lava comes out on the surface of the Earth. It is mostly basaltic and spreads over large areas.
- Strombolian Type : Strombolian type is the most typical volcano which are less explosive. There are several small explosive activities where lava is more viscous. It has the power to explode the crust. E.g, Stromboli Volcano, Lipari Island (North Sicily), Mauna Loa Volcano (Hawaiian Island)
- Volcanian Type : In this type, lava is very viscous and the eruptions take place at a longer intervals. Large quantities of pryclastic materials are erupted from them. E.g. Volcanoes in Lipari island group of Mediterranean Sea.
- Vesuvian Type or Plinian Type : In this type long intervals take place between two eruptions. These are extremely violent and their lava is highly viscous. E.g, Volcano that existed near Naples in Italy.
- Pelean Type : In this type, lava is viscous and highly destructive and fast-moving mass gets erupted. E.g., Mounte Pelee on Martinque island in the West Indies.
- Fissure eruption or Quiet Eruption : Large quantity of lava quietly flows up from fissures and spreads out over the surrounding areas. Successive flow of lava results in the growth of lava plateau. E.g., Deccan Plateau.

### Types of Volcanoes on the Basis of Activity
- Active Volcano : A volcano is called an active volcano if the materials mentioned are being released or have released in the recent past. These volcanoes constantly eject volcanic lava, gas and ashes. E.g., Cotopaxi, Mt. Erebus, Mt. Etna, Strombolian etc. Due to its recent activity and nearbly population *Mount Etna* has been designated a *Decade Volcano* by the United Nations
- Dormant Volcano : These are volcanoes, which were active in past, but for several years have not shown any activity, They can erupt very violently and cause huge damage. E.g., Mt. Krakatoa, Vesuvius (italy), Fujiyama (Japan) etc.
- Extinct Volcano : A Volcano which erupted in the distant geological past and there is no longer any active volcanicity. They show no indications of future eruptions. E.g., Popa (Myanmar), Mt Demvand and Koh-Sultan (Iran).

### Types of Volcano on the Basis of Nature of Eruption
- **Shield Volcanoes** : Barring the basalt flows, the shield volanoes are the largest of all the volcanoes on the Earth. The Hawaiian volcanoes are the most famous examples. Since the volanoes are mostly made up of very fluid basalt, this is the reason, these volcanoes are not steep. They are characterised by low-explosivity. When water gets into the vent, they become explosive. The upcoming lava moves in the form of a fountain and throws out the cone at the top of the vent and develops into a cinder cone.
- **Composite Volcanoes** : These are the most explosive of Earth's volcanoes. When they erupt, they tent to collapse on themselves rather than building any tall structure. The collapsed depressions are called Calderas. Their magma chamber supplying the lava is not only huge but also in close vicinity.
- **Flood Basalt Provinces** These volcanoes outpour highly fluid lava that flows for long distances. There can be a series of flows with some flows attaining thickness of more than 50 m. The Deccan traps from India, are a much larger floor basalt province. It is believed that initially the traop formations covered a much larger area than the present.
- **Mid-Ocean Ridge Volcanoes** These volcanoes occur in the oceanic areas. There is a system of mid-ocean ridges more than 70,000 km long that stretches through all the ocean basins. The central portion of this ridge experiences frequent eruptions.
