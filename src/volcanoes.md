# Volcanoes

- Volacnism includes all the phenomena associated with movement of molten material from interior of the Earth to the Surface.
- A volcano is an opening in the Earth's crust through which molten materials come out. It is also the place where gases, ashes and molten rock material escape to the ground.
- The mantle contains a weaker zone called the asthenosphere. From the asthenosphere, molten rock material comes out to the surface.
- The material in the upper mantle portion is called magma. Once it starts moving towards the crust or it reaches the surface it is called as lava.
- The material that reaches the ground includes lava flows, pyroclastic debris, volcanic bombs, ash and dush and gases such as nitrogen compounds, sulphur compounds and minor amounts of cholrine, hydrogen and argon.
- Bullet Crater of a volcano is a cylindrical opening through which magma or lava comes out to the surface of the Earth.
