# Temperature
- Temperature is the measure of *measurable* heat in the object. Cold is not opposite of heat, it is *absence* of heat. Darkness is absence of light.
- There are two types of heat energy. One that changes temperature, we call it *Specific heat* whereas the heat energy which changes the state is called as *Latent heat*. For example the latent heat does not change temperature, rather it will change the state (solid <--> liquid <--> gas).
- The temperature is the measure of *Specific heat*

## Atmospheric temperature
- Atmospheric temperature tries to measure the air temperature also known as *Ambient Air Temperature* which is measured not directly under the sunlight but normally under shade so that the direct effect of sunlight does not affect the air temperature.
- Importance of atmospheric temperature :
  - Atmospheric temperature affects the moisture available in the air if water is present on the surface of the earth, for example around lakes or rivers if the temperature is higher, more evaporation can take place and hence more moisture or humidity will be there in the air.
  - But if the temperature is very cold then over such regions much evaporation will not take place and hence less humidity will be there in the air.
> Hence simply said, temperature increase; increases the moisture carrying capacity of the air. But carrying capacity does not mean that moisture will be there for sure.
  - For example, in hot desert regions the air will have high moisture carrying capacity due to high temperature but due to desert dry conditions much water is not available for evaporation, hence much moisture might not be there in the air.

## Factors affecting Temperature
- Latitude
  - Latitude is the first factor affecting temperature.
    - At the equator, the temperature is relatively less because the equator is relatively cloudy, whereas the tropics have more sunshine and hence they are hotter.
    - As we move towards the pole the effect of sun rays become more and more inclined and hence lower temperature.
> All the weather and climate phenomena take place in the troposphere only, they do not take place beyond that.
- Altitude
  - Altitude is the second factor that affects the temperature
    - Altitude means the vertical height from the surface of the earth upward. The temperature decreases by 1 degree celsius for every 165 meters increase in the altitude.
    - The temperature fall is an average of 6 to 6.5 degree celsius for every 1 km of height from the earth surface. This is also not always constant. This varies along with summar / winter, the temperature falls faster with altitude whereas during night / winter it falls slower with altitude.
    - This is because the temperature below the tropopause does not vary during day and night or summer or winter. But the surface temperature is higher during the summer or day time and it is lower during winter or night time. So the temperature gradient is more during the summer which causes faster temperature fall.
> During summer, the temperature falls faster with altitude as compared to winters.
  - Land has a lower specific heat than water, because of which if the same amount of heat is falling on the land and the water, then the land will get hotter by absorbing the same heat whereas the water will get less warmer. This is also because only very little depth of the land gets heated directly by the sunlight (few centimeters or meters) whereas in a water body the sunlight might penetrate to good depth (in the oceans this depth can be up to 400 meters). hence in the oceans the same amount of heat is warming up a larger volume of water and hence lesser temperature rise or fall than land whereas a lesser volume of land gets heater or colder.
> Land has lower specific heat and water has higher specific heat. It means water needs more energy to change temperature and land needs less energy
- Continentality effect
  - It means the effect of the continental region on the temperature.
  - Continentality effect means that places on the earth, that are closer to the continents and when we are on the continent, then places in the interior of the continents behave more extreme with respect to the surrounding temperature or expected temperature.
  - Simply said this means that continental places which are closer to the continent and much interior to the continent will have more hotter than normal during summers and more colder than normal during winters, especially in the continental interiors away from the cost.
  - This is known as continentality effect or the effect of the land.
> Continentality has the severing effect, if it is hot -> it makes even hotter and if its cold, it will make it even more colder.
- Maritime (Oceanity) effect)
  - It means the effect of the oceanic region on the temperature.
  - The maritime effect or the oceanity effect is that the places away from the continents in the open oceans (when we are talking of oceans only) or places near to the coast lines away from the continental interior (when we are talking of continents only) are having a moderated temperature due to the oceans effects which means during summer season such places will not be so hot whereas during the winter season such places will not be so cold.
  - This is known as the moderating effect of the oceans.
  - It has a moderating effect on temperature.
> The moderating effect of oceans and the extreme nature of continental climates are primarily due to the high specific heat, vertical mixing, evaporative cooling, and heat storage capacity of water compared to land.
- Effect of ocean currents on temperature
  - An Ocean current is a unidirectional long distance large volume, slow, round the year movement of ocean water (in this case surface ocean water). If the water is moving from a colder region (like poles) to a warmer regions (like tropics) then we call it a cold current, because it is carrying cold water and will make destination region (tropical region in this case) cooler. The warm current is just opposite of a cold current.
  - Hence simply said, cold currents make their destination region cooler whereas warm currents make their destination regions warmer.
- Air Masses
  - An air mass is a large homogenous packet of air having somewhat uniform characteristics of humidity and temperature.
  - Hence such a large packet of air over a cold region would generally have a colder temperature and would be known as *Cold air mass* similarly over the hotter region, if the air mass is formed it would have a hotter temperature and would be known as hotter or warmer air mass.
  - Hence if a colder air mass moves to a less colder region, it will turn the region more cooler than it was and similarly the hotter air mass can make a new region warmer than it was before.
- Slope
  - More sloped surfaces or higher inclination surfaces will cause the spreading of sunlight and hence intense sunlight and hence cooler temperatures.
- Shelter
  - Where the sunlight is not falling, those places will be cooler.
- Aspect
  - Aspect means which side of the mountains will get sunlight and which sides never get sunlight falling on them.
  - For example, due to the aspect effect, southern slopes of himalayas generally get the sunlight during the day whereas northern slopes of himalayas generally do not get sunlight due to the aspect effect.
- Effect of Natural Vegatation
  - Natural vegetation has a moderating effect because in summers when the sunlight is falling, it slows down the sunlight and it keeps relatively colder. During the extreme cold cnditions in the night time, vegetation also releases carbon dioxide and whatever radiation is released from the surface also gets trapped and they will keep the surrounding warm.
> Albedo tells us how reflective a surface is.
- The effect of different types of surfaces
  - Albedo
    - Darker
      - Relatively warmer
      - Absorb more heat
      - Less albedo
    - Lighter
      - Cooler
      - Reflect back more heat
      - Higher albedo
  - Wet / Dry
    - Wetter surfaces
      - Moderating
    - Drier surfaces
      - Severing
> Low albedo and wet surfaces absorb more heat but release it slowly due to evaporation and high heat capacity, producing a moderating effect, whereas high albedo and dry surfaces reflect radiation and undergo rapid heating and cooling, leading to extreme temperatures.
