# Temperature
- Temperature is the measure of *measurable* heat in the object. Cold is not opposite of heat, it is *absence* of heat. Darkness is absence of light.
- There are two types of heat energy. One that changes temperature, we call it *Specific heat* whereas the heat energy which changes the state is called as *Latent heat*. For example the latent heat does not change temperature, rather it will change the state (solid <--> liquid <--> gas).
- The temperature is the measure of *Specific heat*

## Atmospheric temperature
- Atmospheric temperature tries to measure the air temperature also known as *Ambient Air Temperature* which is measured not directly under the sunlight but normally under shade so that the direct effect of sunlight does not affect the air temperature.
- Importance of atmospheric temperature :
  - Atmospheric temperature affects the moisture available in the air if water is present on the surface of the earth, for example around lakes or rivers if the temperature is higher, more evaporation can take place and hence more moisture or humidity will be there in the air.
  - But if the temperature is very cold then over such regions much evaporation will not take place and hence less humidity will be there in the air.
> Hence simply said, temperature increase; increases the moisture carrying capacity of the air. But carrying capacity does not mean that moisture will be there for sure.
  - For example, in hot desert regions the air will have high moisture carrying capacity due to high temperature but due to desert dry conditions much water is not available for evaporation, hence much moisture might not be there in the air.

## Factors affecting Temperature
- Latitude
  - Latitude is the first factor affecting temperature.
    - At the equator, the temperature is relatively less because the equator is relatively cloudy, whereas the tropics have more sunshine and hence they are hotter.
    - As we move towards the pole the effect of sun rays become more and more inclined and hence lower temperature.
> All the weather and climate phenomena take place in the troposphere only, they do not take place beyond that.
- Altitude
  - Altitude is the second factor that affects the temperature
    - Altitude means the vertical height from the surface of the earth upward. The temperature decreases by 1 degree celsius for every 165 meters increase in the altitude.
    - The temperature fall is an average of 6 to 6.5 degree celsius for every 1 km of height from the earth surface. This is also not always constant. This varies along with summar / winter, the temperature falls faster with altitude whereas during night / winter it falls slower with altitude.
    - This is because the temperature below the tropopause does not vary during day and night or summer or winter. But the surface temperature is higher during the summer or day time and it is lower during winter or night time. So the temperature gradient is more during the summer which causes faster temperature fall.
> During summer, the temperature falls faster with altitude as compared to winters.
  - Land has a lower specific heat than water, because of which if the same amount of heat is falling on the land and the water, then the land will get hotter by absorbing the same heat whereas the water will get less warmer. This is also because only very little depth of the land gets heated directly by the sunlight (few centimeters or meters) whereas in a water body the sunlight might penetrate to good depth (in the oceans this depth can be up to 400 meters). hence in the oceans the same amount of heat is warming up a larger volume of water and hence lesser temperature rise or fall than land whereas a lesser volume of land gets heater or colder.
- Continentality effect
  - It means the effect of the continental region on the temperature.
  - Continentality effect means that places on the earth, that are closer to the continents and when we are on the continent, then places in the interior of the continents behave more extreme with respect to the surrounding temperature or expected temperature.
  - Simply said this means that continental places which are closer to the continent and much interior to the continent will have more hotter than normal during summers and more colder than normal during winters, especially in the continental interiors away from the cost.
  - This is known as continentality effect or the effect of the land.
> Continentality has the severing effect, if it is hot -> it makes even hotter and if its cold, it will make it even more colder.
- Maritime (Oceanity) effect)
  - It means the effect of the oceanic region on the temperature.
  - The maritime effect
